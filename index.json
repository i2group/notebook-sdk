Example 1 Instead of using fixed width and height attributes like this, which results in a fixed-size icon 100 pixels square: <svg width=\"100\" height=\"100\"> <rect x=\"10\" y=\"10\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" /> </svg> Use the viewBox attribute to create a scalable icon with a fixed aspect ratio that grows to fill the available space: <svg viewBox=\"0 0 100 100\"> <rect x=\"10\" y=\"10\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" /> </svg> Example 2 By default, i2 Notebook fills SVG icons to match the current theme. If you provide your icon with inline styling, then the theme is ignored and its appearance in the user interface is your responsibility. For example, this code creates an icon with a thematic fill color in all themes: <svg viewBox=\"0 0 100 100\"> <rect x=\"10\" y=\"10\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" /> </svg> While this code creates a rectangular icon that is always red, regardless of the theme. <svg viewBox=\"0 0 100 100\"> <rect x=\"10\" y=\"10\" width=\"80\" height=\"80\" fill=\"red\"/> </svg>"

It then provides information about all the available plug-in entry points to i2 Notebook. After i2 Notebook loads its user interface, it goes on to load the entry point JavaScript file for each available plug-in. The main() method of each entry point performs some actions against i2 Notebook. For example: Register new commands for i2 Notebook users to run Modify the ribbon to show the new commands Register to receive events from open charts (to control the state of commands based on selection, for example) Register command handlers (to launch a separate application when a command is invoked, for example) Register HTML files for tools that i2 Notebook might display in frames or separate browser windows When the registration work is done, the entry point signals completion to i2 Notebook. After all plug-ins signal completion, i2 Notebook acts upon the registrations and updates its configuration accordingly."

They can provide standalone functionality, such as sending data to an external API; or they can provide a way to open and close a tool view. In the plug-in entry point, you can create commands, choose where those commands are surfaced to the user as actions, and decide when those actions are to be enabled. To see worked examples of creating, surfacing, and removing multiple commands, see the tutorials . Surfacing commands You can surface commands in two areas of the i2 Notebook web client user interface: The application ribbon, on the Home tab or a custom tab . The chart's pop-up menu. Your plug-ins can surface or remove any available commands; not only the ones that you create. If you want to, you can arrange for your plug-in to surface commands from the ribbon in the pop-up menu. Positioning commands When you surface a command in a particular area, you can choose to position the resulting action relative to the other contents of that area. You can surface commands within existing groups, and create your own groups too. Removing commands As well as surfacing commands, you might also want to remove commands from the i2 Notebook web client's user interface, based on the user, the state of your plug-in, or something else. You can remove an action from a particular area of the application, or you can remove a command globally from all areas of the application.

  "guide/data-access.html": {
    "href": "guide/data-access.html",
    "title": "Accessing data from a plug-in",
    "keywords": "Accessing data from a plug-in The i2 Notebook Web API provides access to a range of information about the application as a whole, and the data on the chart in particular. In your plug-in code, you can use the API to retrieve this data, as well as to engage with the events happening on the chart. Often, you'll need to do both at the same time. Application data Data that's relevant to the whole application, such as user , theme , and locale data, is available through both the entry point API and the tool view API . Both extend the IApplication interface that defines precisely what information is available. Because the API is asynchronous, however, it can take some time for application data to become available. A delay might be a problem when you are creating a tool view and you want to render something straight away, without waiting for the API. To address this issue, the i2 Notebook web client makes some application data available in the URL that it passes to a new tool view. Specifically, you can retrieve theme and locale data from the following query parameters: ?baseTextDirection ?flowDirection ?formattingLocale ?translationLocale ?themeName ?appearance No matter how you access it, application data is stable and cannot become inconsistent. It is available to your plug-in code at all times, in any context where you need it. Chart data Unlike application data, the data in and around an i2 Notebook chart can change quickly. For example, users can add and remove records from the chart, or change the selection, or change what the current view contains. To ensure that data does not change while you access or manipulate it from your plug-in code, you can only access chart data when i2 Notebook passes it to you in the arguments to callback methods. You can register for the i2 Notebook web client to call your methods in three different circumstances: As a handler for events that take place in the application, such as chart and selection changes As a handler that runs when a user invokes a command through the user interface As a handler that i2 Notebook calls when you specifically ask it to start a transaction Most handlers can receive a payload that implements the IApplicationContents interface , which provides access to all of the schema, visual, and record data for the chart. Some handlers can also receive contextual data, such as information about the changes to records that caused the handler to be called. Schema data Every chart in the i2 Notebook web client has a set of schemas that define what types of records can appear on the chart, and the rules that govern records' properties, notes, and security settings. In a handler that receives an application contents object, you can retrieve schema information from the IApplicationContents.chart.schema property . Visual data Visual data in the i2 Notebook web client comes in two flavors. First, there's what the chart itself looks like: its center, its extent, and its zoom level. That information is available as part of the application contents, through the IApplicationContents.chart.view property . The second kind of visual data is about the elements - that is, the nodes and edges - that users interact with on the chart surface. This information is also available from the application contents, through IApplicationContents.chart.elements and other properties. In addition to the application contents, some event handlers receive more specific visual data. For example, the payload of the chartselectionchange event includes an object that implements the ISelection interface , while the chartviewchange event provides direct access to the IChartView interface . Record data Every element on an i2 Notebook chart can contain records. Each record contains: Property data Metadata, including: Creation date and time Display name and principal name Notes, source references, and security information As with the other kinds of chart data, you can get information about all the records on the chart from the application contents, this time through IApplicationContents.chart.records and other properties. But like the visual data, some event handlers also receive more specific record data. For example, for small changes to the chart, the payload of the chartchange event contains an object that contains the records (and the elements) that changed. Additionally, the onExecute() method that runs when a user invokes a command can receive an IRecordsContext object representing the records that were selected at the time. Further reading For information about the types of events that your plug-ins can listen for, see the documentation for the ApplicationEventMap interface . To find out about setting up a transaction, see the runTransaction() method . For demonstrations of both, see the Angular , React , or Vue plug-in tutorials."

    "keywords": "The plug-in development proxy In a production deployment of i2 Analyze, the i2 Notebook web client connects to the server and fetches the plug-ins that are deployed on that server: Developing any software, including an i2 Notebook plug-in, is an iterative process: we write code, try it out, write some more code, and so on. If we had to deploy our plug-in code to the i2 Analyze server each time around that iterative loop, it would cost a lot of time and disrupt other server users. The i2 Notebook SDK provides a more efficient environment in which to develop an i2 Notebook plug-in, through the use of a development proxy: The SDK proxy server sits in front of both the i2 Analyze server and your plug-in development environment (for example, a React, Angular, or Vue development server). The proxy passes most traffic through to the i2 Analyze server untouched, but it intercepts and modifies requests pertaining to plug-ins. In this way, the proxy server can add your in-development plug-ins \"on top\" of the i2 Analyze server environment. The effect of using the proxy is that you can layer a development plug-in on top of an existing i2 Analyze server without affecting that server; and you can use the plug-in live from your development environment without having to copy files around. Using the development proxy To use the development proxy, you just need to tell it where to find the i2 Analyze server and your in-development plug-ins, and then launch and connect to it. Configuring the proxy You provide the information that configures the proxy in a JSON file that can have any name, and be placed anywhere in your file system. The i2 Notebook SDK includes a JSON schema that enforces the structure and content of the development proxy configuration file. You can use the schema to assist during configuration from a compatible editor such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code. To reference the schema from your configuration file, include the \"$schema\" field as the first entry, like this: { \"$schema\": \"https://i2group.github.io/notebook-sdk/schemas/devproxy.json\", ... } Development proxy configuration syntax The following fields are valid in an i2 Notebook development proxy configuration file: Name Mandatory? Description plugins Yes The URLs of the development plug-ins. This is an array of strings, with each URL pointing to the root of a plug-in (where the plugin.json file is located). port Yes The TCP port that the development proxy should listen on. For example, 4000 . server Yes The URL of the i2 Analyze server. skipHttpsCertificateVerification No A boolean ( true / false ) indicating whether to skip HTTPS certificate verification. The development proxy is unable to verify some HTTPS (SSL/TLS) certificates, so if either the i2 Analyze server or any plug-ins are running on https:// addresses, you must set this field to true to allow the proxy to run. Be aware that when this field is true , no certificate checking takes place. For example: { \"$schema\": \"https://i2group.github.io/notebook-sdk/schemas/devproxy.json\", \"server\": \"http://i2analyze-server/opal/\", \"port\": 4000, \"plugins\": [\"http://localhost:3000\", \"http://localhost:4200\"] } Launching the proxy The only prerequisite for the development proxy is that you have at least version 12 of Node.js on your development machine. No other installations are required. If you named your configuration devproxy.json , then you can launch the proxy with: npx @i2analyze/notebook-sdk-plugin-proxy --config devproxy.json The proxy starts after a few seconds, with output similar to this: Then, while you're developing plug-ins, use the URL of the proxy in your web browser instead of the i2 Analyze server URL. The i2 Notebook web client that you see through the proxy includes your in-development plug-ins. Note: If you're using Create React App (CRA) or Vue CLI to develop your plug-in, be aware that these servers only support IPv4, and might not be compatible with the latest version of the proxy. To ensure compatibility with these servers, use the following command to launch the latest version of the proxy with the --forceIPv4 flag: npx @i2analyze/notebook-sdk-plugin-proxy@latest --config devproxy.json --forceIPv4 Alternatively, you can opt to use version 1 of the proxy specifically: npx @i2analyze/notebook-sdk-plugin-proxy@1 --config devproxy.json Proxy functions In addition to layering development plug-ins on top of an existing i2 Analyze server, the proxy provides the following functions: It validates any plugin.json (plug-in manifest) files. Any problems are reported to the proxy's console output. It simulates an accurate URL path that your plug-in will eventually be deployed to. (For example, the /opal/plugins/xxxxx/ paths in the above output.) This information helps you to identify problems with intra-plug-in paths before you get to deployment. It switches the i2 Notebook application into a \"stricter\" plug-in development mode that makes it more sensitive to incorrect API usage at a small performance cost. Shutting down and restarting the proxy When you no longer require the proxy, you can shut it down with the Ctrl+C keyboard combination. If you change the proxy configuration file, you must stop and restart the proxy manually. However, changes to plug-in manifest files, stopping and starting plug-in development servers, and restarting the i2 Analyze server do not require proxy restarts.

    "title": "The plug-in entry point",
    "keywords": "The plug-in entry point Every i2 Notebook plug-in has an entry point , which is a JavaScript file that the i2 Notebook web client runs when it starts up. The entry point is responsible for several important aspects of a plug-in's functionality, including: Registering and surfacing commands Registering tool views Arranging access to chart data Telling i2 Notebook that initialization of the plug-in is complete Conventionally, the entry point file is named entrypoint.js , but you can choose its name and location when you specify it in the \"entryPointUrl\" field of the plug-in manifest. Accessing the entry point API To perform any of its tasks, the entry point must get access to the entry point API that the i2 Notebook web client makes available through the IEntryPointApi interface. To access the interface, you use the getEntryPointApi() function, which you can call in one of two ways: If you build the entry point file using a bundler such as webpack or parcel, you can import the getEntryPointApi() function directly from the @i2analyze/notebook-sdk package. If you use an unbundled entry point file, you can call the getEntryPointApi() function on the global notebook object. getEntryPointApi() is asynchronous. On completion, it returns an entry point API object, through which you can access the rest of the API. Checking compatibility When you call getEntryPointApi() , you can use the apiVersion parameter to check that the i2 Notebook web client you're communicating with supports the Notebook API version that you need. If the web client doesn't support the requested API version, you'll see an error message in the browser console. For example, imagine that you've been using version 2.4 of the i2 Notebook SDK to develop your plug-in, but that you then attempt to use it with a client that supports supports only API version 2.3. Your call to getEntryPointApi() might look like this: const api = await notebook.getEntryPointApi('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000', '2.4'); This call will fail, because the web client doesn't support API version 2.4. On the other hand, if your call to getEntryPointApi() specifies version 2.2, then the call will succeed and you'll receive an entry point object that supports version 2. 3 of the API. Note: Requesting API version 2.2 doesn't guarantee that the object you receive supports exactly that version. On success, getEntryPointApi() always returns the latest version of the API that the Notebook web client implements. New minor versions of the Notebook API are backward-compatible with old versions. You can find out which version of the API an interface, a type, or other functionality was introduced in by checking for the Introduced keyword in the documentation or the @since indicator in the type definition file. For example: /** * An example type. * @since Major.Minor */ export type Message = string; See the related documentation topic for more information about i2's policy on SDK and API versioning . Registering commands The entry point is where you register the commands that your plug-in adds to the i2 Notebook web client user interface. You can arrange for a command to display a tool view that your plug-in implements, or to perform a task in its own right. By integrating with the web client's event system, you can make commands appear in the application ribbon and the chart pop-up menu. And you can disable or enable commands according to the current context. Registering tool views The entry point is also where you register the tool views through which your plug-in can display its own user interface, inside the i2 Notebook web client. Tool views consist of HTML pages and code for performing custom user tasks. In the entry point, you must provide the web client with the location of that code. Accessing chart data The IEntryPointApi interface provides full access to all chart data and metadata: the data that records contain, their visual representation, the schema that defines their types, and whether they are currently selected. The same interface gives your plug-in code the ability to subscribe to events in the i2 Notebook web client, so that your code is called when data or selections change. Entry point lifecycle After the entry point file loads, it must perform command and tool view registrations quickly. The i2 Notebook web client blocks its startup until these registrations are complete, so that it can render its user interface in one go without elements shifting around. When your registrations are complete, your entry point must call the initializationComplete() method on the IEntryPointApi interface. Failure to do so delays the start of the i2 Notebook web client, and causes your plug-in to be shut down. After the call to initializationComplete() , no further commands or tool views can be registered or surfaced."

The i2 Notebook Web API includes functionality to assist with maintaining the flow of the user interface and the direction of the text it contains; and with keeping consistency between your plug-ins and the application itself. Formatting data for display In your plug-in code, you might need to format record data according to formatting and translation locales (to comply with pluralization rules, for example) so that it is always displayed appropriately. The API provides the IFormatter interface , whose methods can help you with the formatting process. Using the API is always better than manipulating values directly. Maintaining user interface flow and text direction The i2 Notebook application supports languages that use right-to-left writing systems, such as Arabic and Hebrew. The API provides the ILocale interface , whose properties provide information about the application's user interface flow direction, the user's chosen text direction, and precise locales for formatting and translation. Controlling bidirectional text using Unicode Sometimes, a piece of text in a language that uses a right-to-left script can include numbers or text in Latin or another script that flows from left to right. In order for the application to display text correctly in such circumstances, you need to tell it what direction applies to different parts of the text. The i2 Notebook Web API provides the wrapForBidi() method to address this issue. This method uses invisible Unicode characters to \"wrap\" sections of text so that the application knows how to display them correctly. The Angular , React , and Vue tutorials address the issue of bidirectionality, and demonstrate using wrapForBidi() to control it."

  "guide/manifest.html": {
    "href": "guide/manifest.html",
    "title": "The plug-in manifest",
    "keywords": "The plug-in manifest Every i2 Notebook plug-in requires a manifest , which is a JSON file that provides configuration settings for the plug-in. The file must appear at the root of the plug-in directory, and it must be named plugin.json . Most of the settings that the manifest can provide are mandatory. The file must contain the following information: A unique identifier for the i2 Notebook plug-in The version of the plug-in A name for the plug-in, to appear in diagnostic messages for plug-in lifecycle events The path to the entry point JavaScript file to load, relative to the manifest Optionally, the manifest can also specify changes to i2 Notebook's content security policy, so that the plug-in can access content on servers that the policy would otherwise block. Creating a manifest The i2 Notebook SDK includes a JSON schema that enforces the structure and content of plug-in manifests. The Liberty server validates your manifests when it reads them, but you can also use the schema to assist during manifest creation from a compatible editor (such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code). The file name of the schema is plugin-manifest.json . To reference it from your plugin.json file, include the $schema field as the first entry in the manifest, like this: { \"$schema\": \"https://i2group.github.io/notebook-sdk/schemas/plugin-manifest.json\", ... } After you set this field, editors that support JSON schemas provide inline help to ensure that mandatory fields in the manifest are present and populated with valid values. Plug-in manifest syntax The following fields are valid in an i2 Notebook plug-in manifest: Name Mandatory? Description entryPointCsp No Directives to add to the HTTP Content-Security-Policy response header for the entry point JavaScript file. entryPointUrl Yes The URL of the entry point JavaScript file, relative to the manifest file. name Yes The name of the plug-in, which might appear in status messages. pluginId Yes The identifier of the plug-in, as a lower-case GUID . pluginVersion Yes The version of the plug-in, typically in x[.y[.z]] format. toolViewCsp No Directives to add to the HTTP Content-Security-Policy response header for tool view files. For example: { \"$schema\": \"https://i2group.github.io/notebook-sdk/schemas/plugin-manifest.json\", \"pluginId\": \"01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef\", \"pluginVersion\": \"1.0\", \"name\": \"My i2 Notebook plug-in\", \"entryPointUrl\": \"./entrypoint.js\", \"toolViewCsp\": { ... } } Content security policy directives By default, i2 Notebook's content security policy (CSP) prevents plug-ins from accessing some kinds of information on servers that are not the i2 Analyze server. However, and especially if your plug-in uses tool views, you might need to use code, fonts, or other data that are located on another server. In such cases, you can use the toolViewCsp field to allow access to that server from tool views. In rarer cases (but for the same reasons), you might need to change the CSP that applies to the entry point JavaScript file. For example, if you want to connect to a remote service on the execution of a command, you can use the entryPointCsp field to allow access to the service for that purpose. For more information about CSP directives and how to choose which ones you need, see the documentation at MDN Web Docs . In the manifest, you populate entryPointCsp and toolViewCsp with fields whose names match CSP directive names, and whose values are the URLs of servers that your plug-in will access, or are drawn from a small group of keywords: { ... \"entryPointCsp\": { \"connect-src\": \"http://external-server-to-access-from-entry-point\", }, \"toolViewCsp\": { \"connect-src\": \"http://external-server-to-access-from-tool-view\", \"img-src\": \"http://external-server-that-provides-images\" } } Note: To specify more than one value in a \"connect-src\" or \"img-src\" field, you can add space-separated values between the double-quote characters. For example: \"http://external.com http://example.com\" The set of available CSP directives can and does change over time. Especially if your plug-ins make regular use of CSP directives, ensure that you stay abreast of updates to the MDN documentation."

  "guide/mutation-commands.html": {
    "href": "guide/mutation-commands.html",
    "title": "Supported mutation operations",
    "keywords": "Supported mutation operations As Changing data from a plug-in describes, the i2 Notebook Web API provides the ability to write data to the chart and to change the state of the i2 Notebook application. The types of changes that you can make through the API are: Record creation Record editing Record removal Item type creation Item type editing Selection changes Node position changes Node and edge style changes View changes A single mutation can contain any number of these changes, in any combination. The changes are typically applied when the mutation itself is committed. The i2 Notebook SDK includes a mutations tutorial that demonstrates how to make some of these changes. Creating and editing records The mutation handler that you pass to IApplication.runTrackedMutations() can create entity and link records through the addEntityRecord() and addLinkRecord() methods of the ITrackedMutations object that it receives. To each method, you provide the features of the new record including its item type, its notes, its security settings, and values for its properties. Both add methods return a \"pending\" record object that represents the new record in the mutation, before it is added to the chart. This object implements the IRecordEditor interface, which allows you to make further edits before you commit. To make changes to a record that is already on the chart, you can use the ITrackedMutations.editRecord() method, which also returns an object that implements IRecordEditor . Note: New records, and changes to existing records, do not exist on the chart (and will not be seen in IChart collections) until you commit the mutation. Pending records and record editors are only valid in the mutation handler where they were created. Value factories When you create or edit a record from a mutation handler, you can provide values for its properties. Some of these values - temporal and geospatial ones, for example - have reasonably complex structures. To help you construct valid values, ITrackedMutations.valueFactory provides an IValueFactory object that contains helper methods for creating objects of the following types: IGeopoint IDecimal ILocalDate ILocalDateTime ILocalTime ISecuritySettings IZonedDateTime Removing records and elements Just as a mutation handler can create and edit records, it can also remove them from the chart, through the ITrackedMutations.removeRecords() method. You can also remove visual nodes and edges from the chart by calling the ITrackedMutations.removeElements() method. Doing so implicitly removes any records that an element contains, while removing a node also removes any connected edges. Creating and editing item types When you create a record, you specify its item type. Often, you will use an item type that already exists in the chart schema, but you can also use a tracked mutation handler to create item types and to edit existing ones. For item types that you create, you can configure their behavior and add and edit property types both during and after creation. For existing item types, you can only add or edit custom property types. To create a custom entity type in the chart schema, you call the ITrackedMutations.addEntityType() method. To create a custom link type, you call ITrackedMutations.addLinkType() . You can use the ITrackedMutations.editItemType() method to modify the custom item types that you create, or to add custom property types to existing item types. There is no method to remove a custom item type, although you can use the undo action to reverse creation if you do so immediately afterwards. For information about the item types that are added or changed in the chart schema, you can: Check the chartSchemaChange object in the mutation result. Listen for the chartschemachange event from the application. Changing selection You can change the selection state of the chart through tracked and untracked mutation handlers. ITrackedMutations and IUntrackedMutations both inherit IMutationsBase.selection , which provides an implementation of the ISelectionEditor interface. Note: Selection changes in untracked mutations are not explicitly added to the undo stack, but the next tracked mutation can capture the current selection as part of its undoable state. Moving nodes on the chart From a tracked mutation handler, you can arrange the nodes on the chart by changing their positions one-by-one, or as a group: Set the position of a single node directly by using the ITrackedMutations.setNodeCenter() method. Move a selection that includes nodes by an offset through the ITrackedMutations.moveSelectedNodesRelative() method. Changing the style of nodes and edges on the chart You can change the visual appearance of node and edges displayed on a chart by using the ITrackedMutations.editNode() and ITrackedMutations.editEdge() methods. Change the size of a node by calling INodeEditor.setSize() Change the colors of edges and nodes by calling INodeEditor.setColor() or IEdgeEditor.setColor() . Local style and label changes You can use untracked mutations ( IUntrackedMutations ) to make local changes to the appearance of nodes and edges on the chart. Changes like these are not sent to the server, and exist only on the browser page displaying the current chart. For example, you can set the label of an edge summary by using the IUntrackedMutations.editEdgeSummary().setLabel() method. Untracked mutations are also not added to the undo/redo stack, which makes them useful in plug-ins that want to alter the appearance of chart elements temporarily without affecting the user's workflow. If you want an untracked mutation to survive an undo operation, you can reapply it in response to a chartchange event. Changing the view Finally, you can use tracked or untracked mutations to change the current view of the chart by moving its center point or changing the zoom level. ITrackedMutations and IUntrackedMutations both inherit IMutationsBase.view , which provides an implementation of the IViewEditor interface. Validation The parameters of all calls to mutation methods are validated to ensure that the correct value types are passed, and that any record and type identifiers are associated with existing objects. A validation failure results in an error notification in the i2 Notebook user interface that provides information about which argument was incorrect."

    "title": "Changing data from a plug-in",
    "keywords": "Changing data from a plug-in The i2 Notebook Web API provides the ability to write data to the chart, either by adding new records or by editing or deleting existing records. The API also allows you to change which records on the chart are selected, and to modify the view state of the chart. All changes to the chart take place asynchronously, and you must perform them using transactions to ensure that they do not conflict with changes made by other plug-ins or users. In the i2 Notebook Web API, you use mutations for this purpose. Mutations are transactions that run as a single atomic action, and contain one or more operations that make changes to chart data or application state. When asked to start a mutation transaction, the application calls a mutation handler that you provide, which receives the following parameters: A parameter of type IApplicationContents , which provides read access to the visual and record data for the chart, as well as to its schema. A parameter that implements one of the ...Mutations interfaces, which provides access to mutation operations that allow changes to record and application state. Commit and rollback Just like database transactions, when your mutation handler finishes, it must indicate whether the mutation operations that it created should be \"committed\" and applied to the chart and application, or \"rolled back\" and not applied. Committing a mutation causes operations in the handler to be applied to the chart. Some operations, such as selection and view changes, are applied immediately. Other operations, such as writing record data, are sent to the server before control returns to the application. Mutation reports When you commit or roll back a mutation, you can opt to provide information that is displayed to the user as a notification pop-up. The ISuccessReport and IDetailedReport define objects that you can return from mutation handlers. Note: The fate of the transaction (commit or rollback) and the report that the user sees (success, failure, or nothing) are independent from each other. Reporting an error to the user is often associated with rolling back the mutation transaction, but you can combine a transaction commit with an error report, or a rollback with a success report. i2 Notebook adheres to two standard design behaviors - demonstrated most obviously in the built-in Expand functionality - that provide a helpful and unobtrusive user experience when you follow them in your own plug-ins: It's not always necessary to provide an explicit success report to the user. For a command that adds data to the chart, the success of the operation is often obvious from the fact that data has been added to the chart. Only provide an explicit \"success\" report if there is something else of value to report to the user. If a command is supposed to add data to the chart but after starting the mutation you discover that there is no (new) data to add, then roll back the transaction and provide an explicit report to the user to indicate that there was nothing to add. (In these circumstances, reporting nothing to the user would leave them uncertain whether the command even ran, harming their confidence in the application and your plug-in.) Deciding whether \"nothing was added\" is a \"success\" or a \"failure\" will depend on factors such as whether the lack of new data is a normal situation or caused by an error. Tracked and untracked mutations i2 Notebook supports two different types of mutation: Tracked mutations , which users can undo, and which you start by calling IApplication.runTrackedMutations() . Your tracked mutation handler receives an ITrackedMutations object, which provides a full set of chart mutation operations. A committed, tracked mutation collects all of its operations into a single entry in the application undo stack. A user can undo all of the changes from a tracked mutation with a single undo action. Untracked mutations , which users cannot undo, and which you start by calling IApplication.runUntrackedMutations() . Your untracked mutation handler receives an IUntrackedMutations object, which provides a more restricted set of chart mutation operations. You can use an untracked mutation to change chart selection, chart view position and zoom level, and some other visual aspects of entities and links on the chart. The operations in an untracked mutation take place without creating an entry in the application undo stack. If your command only affects selection or the view of the chart, then consider implementing it with untracked mutations. For all other commands, use tracked mutations. Cancelation and status messages If you implement a mutation handler as an asynchronous function, the handler can be canceled through the ICancelation object that it receives. Triggering the cancelation automatically rolls back the mutation. While a mutation handler is running, the application can show status messages that your handler provides by using the status property of the ITrackedMutations or IUntrackedMutations interface. For example: // Use an asynchronous mutation handler so that we can wait for the external data. // During the fetch, the application shows a spinner, a message, and a cancel button. getToolViewApi().runTrackedMutations(async (application, mutations, cancelation) => { do { // Fetch some external data, passing in the cancelation signal so that the fetch // is aborted if the signal is. After each fetch, the external resource returns // an object that indicates whether there's more data to fetch. const response = await fetch('http://some-external-service.com', { signal: cancelation.signal }); const responseJSON = response.json(); // Update the application progress message. mutations.status.setMessage('Fetching data'); // We've got the data, so we can create some mutation commands with it. mutations.addEntityRecord(...); // Only carry on with the loop if the signal is not aborted. } while (responseJSON.moreDataToFetch && !cancelation.signal.aborted); // If the signal is aborted, roll back mutations and show a notification. if (cancelation.signal.aborted) { return { type: 'rollback', report: { type: 'warning', title: 'Aborted', details: 'Data fetch aborted' } } } return { type: 'commit', actionDisplayName: 'Fetch data' } });"

This enhancement allows you to improve the user experience by categorizing related features into separate tabs, making navigation more intuitive. Adding a custom tab In the plug-in entry point, you can add a tab by calling IApplicationRibbon.addTab() . The method creates a new tab in the application ribbon, providing a new command area where you can surface commands individually or group them for better organization. const ribbon = api.commands.applicationRibbon; const customTab = ribbon.addTab({ id: 'customTabId', label: 'Insert', }); Adding commands to a tab After you create the tab, you can add commands to it. The commands that you add can be system commands or custom commands that you define in your plug-in. You can add the same command to multiple tabs, or move commands from one tab to another. For example: ribbon.homeTab.remove(api.commands.systemCommands.toggleLists); customTab.surfaceCommands( api.commands.systemCommands.toggleStyling, api.commands.systemCommands.toggleLists ); This code removes the toggleLists command from the Home tab and adds it to the newly created tab. On the other hand, the toggleStyling command is now surfaced in both the Home tab and the custom Insert tab. Grouping commands together in a tab Custom tabs support groups of commands in exactly the same way that the Home tab does. customTab .addGroup({ id: '6878b309-2dfd-4431-9976-1a79d7c7b43a', icon: { type: 'inlineSvg', svg: commandSvg, }, label: 'Revert', isCollapsed: true, }) .surfaceCommands(api.commands.systemCommands.undo, api.commands.systemCommands.redo); This code creates a group in the tab called Revert, and adds the undo and redo system commands to it. The new group is collapsed by default. Positioning tabs When you add a tab to the ribbon, you can specify its position relative to other tabs. For example, if you want to place the custom Insert tab before the Home tab, you can do so like this: const ribbon = api.commands.applicationRibbon; const homeTab = ribbon.homeTab; const customTab = ribbon.addTab( { id: 'customTabId', label: 'Insert', }, homeTab ); In this code, homeTab refers to the existing Home tab. By passing it as the second argument to addTab() , the Insert tab is positioned before the Home tab in the application ribbon."

    "keywords": "Plug-in tool views A tool view is a custom web page that provides the user interface for an i2 Notebook plug-in. The i2 Notebook web client loads and displays tool views right alongside its own user interface elements. The code in a tool view can get access to data in the application through the tool view API, making tool views a convenient way for a plug-in to provide extra functionality to users. You can read, present, and allow users to interact with data all from the same part of your project. What a tool view can do Tool views have direct access to the data on the chart, including the visual elements and the underlying record data. As a result, they can process and analyze that data however you choose. For example, you might create a tool view that uses custom processing to filter the items on a chart, or performs complex data analysis, or integrates with a third-party user interface. Creating a tool view A tool view consists of one or more HTML pages, as well as any resources that those pages require. The tutorials in this SDK provide worked examples of how you might add a tool view to your i2 Notebook plug-in. Note: The tutorials use the Angular, React, and Vue frameworks to simplify some aspects of writing tool views. When you have the source code for a tool view in place, you create it in the plug-in entry point by calling the createToolView() method on the IEntryPointApi interface. A plug-in can create as many tool views as it needs. To enable users to display a tool view, you must create and register a command for doing so, and then surface that command in the i2 Notebook web client user interface. Tool view lifecycle i2 Notebook web client users can open and close a tool view whenever they choose. As a result, a single tool view HTML page might be reloaded multiple times in the course of a single session. A tool view is also reloaded when it is floated or docked, or moved from one part of the user interface to another. Without intervention, any state that a user has built up inside a tool view is lost when it is reloaded. When the lifetime of a particular instance of a tool view is potentially quite short, this behavior is likely to frustrate users. To maintain the state of a tool view, the i2 Notebook Web API provides a volatile store that can save and recover state in response to reload events."

You'll also need to install the Angular CLI, which you can do by following the instructions at https://angular.io/cli . The tutorial also requires you to create GUIDs for a number of its elements. The project files use some sample fixed GUIDs ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 , 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002 , and so on), but you should always create real GUIDs for real projects. Note: A suitable GUID generator is available online at https://www.guidgenerator.com . Create a basic UI-free plug-in A basic i2 Notebook plug-in has the same requirements as a more complex one: in the plug-in directory, you must create the manifest and the entry point that enable the i2 Notebook web client to load and integrate your plug-in. The first part of this tutorial covers those requirements, and also explains how to set up both your development environment and a local Node.js server. Create an empty Angular application with ng new . For example: ng new plugin-ng The command will ask whether you want to use Angular routing. You don't need it for this tutorial, so choose No (the default). It will also ask which stylesheet technology you want to use. Any is fine, but raw CSS builds more quickly than the others, and for this tutorial we'll use css . Don't start the server yet. Change directory to the new plug-in. For example: cd plugin-ng Add the i2 Notebook SDK package: npm install @i2analyze/notebook-sdk The package contains a type library that enables inline assistance in your IDE. Now you're in position to write the plug-in itself, starting with the manifest. Using an IDE such as VSCode, create a file named plugin.json in src , with the following contents: { \"$schema\": \"https://i2group.github.io/notebook-sdk/schemas/plugin-manifest.json\" } The schema enforces the structure and content of the file. For more information, see the plug-in manifest documentation. Continue to populate the manifest with values for \"name\" , \"pluginId\" , and \"pluginVersion\" ; and set \"entryPointUrl\" to \"./entrypoint.js\" . For example: \"name\": \"My i2 Notebook plug-in\", \"pluginId\": \"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001\", \"pluginVersion\": \"1.0.0\", \"entryPointUrl\": \"./entrypoint.js\" Next, we can create the entry point. Add a file named entrypoint.js to the src directory, and populate it: // @ts-check /// <reference types=\"@i2analyze/notebook-sdk\" /> async function main() { const api = await notebook.getEntryPointApi('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001', '1.1'); api.logger.info('plug-in running'); api.initializationComplete(); } void main(); Through this code, the plug-in retrieves the version of the entry point API that it wants to use, and uses it to declare that it has finished initializing. The GUID here must match the one in the plug-in manifest. If you enter the code by hand, you'll see how the type library provides auto-completion as you go. Modify angular.json to configure the Angular builder to treat plugin.json and entrypoint.js as assets: to \"projects\">\"plugin-ng\">\"architect\">\"build\">\"options\">\"assets\" , add \"src/entrypoint.js\" and \"src/plugin.json\" . Back on the command line, start the Angular project in development mode: npm start . Make a note of the connection address. For example, http://localhost:4200 . We'll need that to connect to, and reference, our plug-in. Navigate to the project in a web browser. You should see an Angular demonstration page. Confirm that plugin.json and entrypoint.js are served correctly from their respective paths (for example, http://localhost:4200/plugin.json and http://localhost:4200/entrypoint.js ). Test the plug-in in the i2 Notebook web client While we're developing and testing a plug-in, we won't deploy the plug-in directly to the i2 Analyze server. Instead, we'll use the i2 Notebook SDK plug-in development proxy to add our plug-in to an existing i2 Analyze deployment without needing to modify it. Anywhere on your workstation, create and populate a file named devproxy.json : { \"$schema\": \"https://i2group.github.io/notebook-sdk/schemas/devproxy.json\" } This forms the basis of the configuration file for the development proxy. Add a value for \"server\" that is the URL of an existing i2 Analyze deployment. For example, \"http://localhost:9082/opal/\" . Add a value for \"port\" to specify the port that the development proxy should listen on. For example, 4000 . Add a value for \"plugins\" that contains the root URL of your plug-in. For example, [\"http://localhost:4200/\"] for the server that we configured above. On the command line, navigate to the folder that contains the configuration file, and run the i2 Notebook plug-in development proxy (no installation is required): npx @i2analyze/notebook-sdk-plugin-proxy --config devproxy.json Open the proxy URL in a browser, log in to the i2 Notebook web client and open a new chart. For example, http://localhost:4000/opal/ . Open the browser's developer console and check for our plug-in's message being logged: If you see this message, then the plug-in is working correctly. Add a ribbon command to the plug-in So far, you have a plug-in that's being loaded into the i2 Notebook web client - but it doesn't do anything. Next, we'll make the plug-in add a command that opens geospatial locations in Google Maps to the application ribbon. In entrypoint.js , just before the call to initializationComplete() , create a command: const viewOnMap = api.commands.createCommand({ id: '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002', name: 'View on map', icon: { type: 'inlineSvg', svg: '<svg viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><rect width=\"8\" height=\"8\" x=\"4\" y=\"4\"/></svg>', }, type: 'records', onExecute(payload) {}, }); Straight afterward, surface the command on the ribbon's Home tab, just after the Information Store group: api.commands.applicationRibbon.homeTab .after(api.commands.applicationRibbon.homeTab.systemGroups.searchInfoStore) .surfaceCommands(viewOnMap); Reload the i2 Notebook web client, and check that the action is visible in the application ribbon. Clicking the button won't do anything yet because we haven't implemented onExecute() , so let's do that now. Create this helper function at the top level of the entrypoint.js file: /** * @param {import(\"@i2analyze/notebook-sdk\").data.IReadOnlyCollection<import(\"@i2analyze/notebook-sdk\").records.IChartRecord>} records */ function findGeospatialValue(records) { for (const record of records) { for (const propertyType of record.itemType.propertyTypes) { if (propertyType.logicalType === 'geospatial') { const property = record.getProperty(propertyType); if (property !== undefined && !record.isValueUnfetched(property)) { return /** @type {import(\"@i2analyze/notebook-sdk\").data.IGeoPoint} */ (property); } } } } return undefined; } This function performs a simple scan of the records it receives, looking for a non-empty geospatial property that it returns if it finds one. Note: The /** @type {import...} */ and /** @param {import...} */ code helps the JavaScript type system to understand what we're working with, which enables auto-completion in the rest of the code. If we used TypeScript to create our entrypoint.js file, we'd use import type statements instead. We can now use the helper function in the implementation of onExecute() that we left empty in the call to CreateCommand() . We'll take the latitude and longitude to a new Google Maps window: onExecute(payload) { const property = findGeospatialValue(payload.records); if (!property) { return; } window.open( `https://www.google.com/maps/@${property.latitude},${property.longitude},18z`, \"_blank\" ); }, Reload the web client again, select an element with a geospatial property, and try the command. Google Maps should open at the relevant location. Make the command sensitive to selection There's a problem with our command: the button is enabled even if the selection doesn't actually contain a geospatial property. That would be misleading for a user, but we can fix it by taking control of the surfacing of the command in the user interface. After the onExecute() parameter to createCommand() , add an onSurface() function definition: onSurface(action, eventApi, signal) { eventApi.addEventListener( \"recordscontextchange\", (context) => { action.setEnabled(!!findGeospatialValue(context.records)); }, { dispatchNow: true, signal } ); }, There are a few things to notice here: i2 Notebook calls our onSurface() function with an action object that represents the user interface control to which the command is bound each time it is surfaced. A single command might be surfaced in several places, and you can use the action object to react differently in each of them. The function also receives an eventApi object through which it can listen to changes in the records to which the action is being applied; and a signal object that indicates when this particular surfacing of the command is being removed. In our implementation, we subscribe to the recordscontextchange event, which tells us when the current records change. When they do change, we set the enabled state of the action to a value based on whether there is a geospatial value in the current records. Event listeners are normally invoked when the event occurs. However, we don't want to wait for a recordscontextchange event before we run our setEnabled() code, so we specify dispatchNow: true to invoke the callback immediately, without waiting for the event. This in turn causes our action to be enabled or disabled correctly, right away. We forward the signal to the event listener so that it unsubscribes automatically from the recordscontextchange event when the action is unsurfaced. Reload the i2 Notebook web client. The button in the application ribbon is now enabled only when a geospatial property exists in the selection. Use the command in more than one place As well as adding it to the ribbon, we can add exactly the same command to the chart pop-up menu with a single line of code. After the existing call to surfaceCommands() , add: api.commands.chartPopupMenu.surfaceCommands(viewOnMap); Reload the web client. The same command, with the same enablement rules, is now present in the chart's pop-up menu. Create a tool view The first part of this tutorial didn't use any features from the Angular framework! That changes now, as we use Angular to create a custom user interface for our plug-in. On the command line, navigate to the project directory and run the following command to create an Angular component called 'toolView1': ng generate component toolView1 Navigate to the src/app folder inside the project directory, and replace the contents of the generated app.component.html file with: <div> <app-tool-view1></app-tool-view1> </div> In a web browser, load the root page ( / ) from your Angular development environment ( http://localhost:4200/ ). You should see the default message, \"tool-view1 works!\". We'll now turn the Angular component into an i2 Notebook tool view. In src/entrypoint.js , insert a line before the call to initializationComplete() : const toolView = api.createToolView('My tool view', './'); This line declares a tool view by specifying its display name ('My tool view') and its location relative to the entry point , which is ' ./ '. Still in the entry point code, tell i2 Notebook to create a command that opens and closes the tool view: const toggle = api.commands.createToolViewToggleCommand( { id: '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000003', name: 'My tool', icon: { type: 'inlineSvg', svg: '<svg viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><circle cx=\"8\" cy=\"8\" r=\"4\" /></svg>', }, }, toolView ); Finally, surface the command in the application ribbon's Home tab. This code places it after the View on map command that we developed above: api.commands.applicationRibbon.homeTab.after(viewOnMap.id).surfaceCommands(toggle); Reload the i2 Notebook web client, and you'll see the new button in the ribbon. Click it to display the tool view in the user interface; click it a second time to hide it again. However, the tool view itself doesn't look right, because the .js and .css files aren't being loaded correctly. To see what's happening, open up the developer tools in your browser, and look at the network diagnostics. When you click to display the tool view, you'll see that the requests for files such as main.js and styles.css are failing. We'll fix those problems in the next section. Configure Angular to serve content from the correct place New Angular applications are hard-wired to serve their content from the root ( / ) of the server they're running on. i2 Notebook plug-ins, on the other hand, are served from <context root>/plugins/<some directory> on the i2 Analyze server, and our plug-in development proxy is simulating that for us. When you display the Angular tool view, the .html file loads correctly, but the .css and .js files fail to load because the .html file refers to them relative to the root - for example, /styles.css . This would work if the plug-in were served from / , but as it won't be, we need to make Angular generate the paths differently. Edit angular.json . At the path \"projects\" > \"plugin-ng\" > \"architect\" > \"build\" > \"options\" , add a \"baseHref\" field and set its value to \".\" . This setting tells Angular to use paths relative to . instead of / , which causes generated HTML files to refer to their .css and .js files in the same folder, which is exactly what we want for this example. Restart the Angular development server. (This is always necessary after you edit angular.json .) Reload the i2 Notebook web client and try the tool view again. The 'tool-view1 works!' text should now be displayed in the tool view panel. However, if you're using a dark theme in the application, it might be hard to see the black text on a dark background. We'll fix that by adding some simple theming support, but before we can do so, we must fix another problem. Look in the browser console, and you'll see some warnings about the browser refusing to apply inline styles because of a violation of a Content Security Policy (CSP) directive. We must fix that before we'll be able to apply any styling successfully. Configure the Content Security Policy i2 Notebook runs with a heavily locked-down Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the attack surface. Angular, however, uses features (specifically, inline styling) that require a looser CSP. We can use the plug-in manifest to loosen the CSP for our tool view. Edit the src/plugin.json file and add a \"toolViewCsp\" section: \"toolViewCsp\": { \"style-src\": \"'unsafe-inline'\" } Once again, reload the i2 Notebook web client and display the tool view. The browser console will now be free of styling CSP errors, so we can proceed with some styling. Note: If you open the developer tools at this point and look at the console, you will still see other CSP errors where Angular is trying to connect to sockjs-node/info . These violations are due to the Angular application developer environment, and you can safely ignore them. Create a service that provides the tool view API We'll need to access the i2 Notebook tool view API from multiple components in our Angular application. Also, because fetching the API is asynchronous, we'll want to prevent the Angular application from loading until it is ready and available to use. To address both of these requirements, we can make the tool view API available through an Angular service. Back on the command line, run the following command to create an Angular service: ng generate service toolViewApi The command places a skeleton file named tool-view-api.service.ts in the src/app directory. Edit tool-view-api.service.ts , replacing the file contents with the following: import { Injectable } from '@angular/core'; import { getToolViewApi, toolview } from '@i2analyze/notebook-sdk'; @Injectable({ providedIn: 'root', }) export class ToolViewApiService { constructor() {} private api!: toolview.IToolViewApi; async init() { this.api = await getToolViewApi(); } public getApi() { return this.api; } } This service has an init() method that we'll call to set up the API, and a getApi() method that we can call from our components to acquire and use the API. In tool-view-api.service.ts , after the ToolViewApiService class declaration, create an exported function named initializeToolViewApiServiceFactory() : export function initializeToolViewApiServiceFactory(service: ToolViewApiService) { return () => service.init(); } We're going to use this function in the next step to wait until the service is initialized before we declare that our Angular application is ready to load. In src/app/app.module.ts : Add the APP_INITIALIZER import from @angular/core right at the top of the file: import { APP_INITIALIZER, NgModule } from '@angular/core'; Add imports for initializeToolViewApiServiceFactory and ToolViewApiService from ./tool-view-api.service : import { ToolViewApiService, initializeToolViewApiServiceFactory, } from './tool-view-api.service'; In the @NgModule decorator, after imports , add a providers section: @NgModule({ declarations: [AppComponent, ToolView1Component], imports: [BrowserModule], providers: [ { provide: APP_INITIALIZER, useFactory: initializeToolViewApiServiceFactory, deps: [ToolViewApiService], multi: true, }, ], bootstrap: [AppComponent], }) This section creates a provider for an initialization function for our Angular application. The application only loads the AppComponent when initialization is complete and we have fetched the tool view API. Configure the tool view for i2 Notebook web client themes The i2 Notebook web client supports a number of visual themes. If you're using a light theme, the \"tool-view1 works!\" text should have been clear in your tool view. But if you're using a dark theme, the text was probably harder to read. We haven't yet configured the tool view to respect and respond to themes. Note: To change the theme in the i2 Notebook web client, go to the user menu and select Settings to open the Settings dialog. To style our tool view correctly, we need to access the theme information. At the top of the src/app/app.component.ts file, import ToolViewApiService from ./tool-view-api.service : import { ToolViewApiService } from './tool-view-api.service'; Use dependency injection to inject ToolViewApiService into the AppComponent class, and populate it: export class AppComponent { constructor(service: ToolViewApiService) { const toolViewApi = service.getApi(); } } Theme information is now available from toolViewApi.theme.appearance , which tells us if the current theme is light or dark . With the theme information, create a variable that we can use to set the component styling: export class AppComponent { public readonly isDarkTheme: boolean; constructor(service: ToolViewApiService) { const toolViewApi = service.getApi(); this.isDarkTheme = toolViewApi.theme.appearance === 'dark'; } } We can use isDarkTheme to change how Angular generates the CSS, but first open src/app/app.component.css and populate it with the following: .dark-theme { color: white; } .light-theme { color: black; } In other words, we want to set the font color to white in dark themes, and to black in light themes. Open app.component.html , and replace the class attribute with the [ngClass] directive: <div [ngClass]=\"{ 'light-theme': !isDarkTheme, 'dark-theme': isDarkTheme }\"> <app-tool-view1></app-tool-view1> </div> Now, our tool view will apply the light-theme or dark-theme class based on theme information from the i2 Notebook web client. Reload the i2 Notebook web client and display the tool view again. Change the theme by swopping between light and dark, and notice how the tool view automatically adjusts its text coloring to match. Access record data We've done a lot of work to make our tool view integrate nicely with the i2 Notebook web client. Now it needs to do something useful. Let's enable it to access the data in selected records, which starts by working out what the current selection is : At the top of the src/app/tool-view1/tool-view1.component.ts file, import ToolViewApiService from ../tool-view-api.service : import { ToolViewApiService } from '../tool-view-api.service'; Also import the toolview namespace from @i2analyze/notebook-sdk : import type { toolview } from '@i2analyze/notebook-sdk'; Use dependency injection to inject ToolViewApiService into the ToolView1Component class, and populate it: export class ToolView1Component implements OnInit { private readonly toolViewApi: toolview.IToolViewApi; constructor(service: ToolViewApiService) { this.toolViewApi = service.getApi(); } ngOnInit(): void {} } In the ngOnInit() function, subscribe to the chartselectionchange event: ngOnInit(): void { this.toolViewApi.addEventListener( 'chartselectionchange', this.handleChartSelectionChange ); } And then add a method to ToolView1Component to handle it: private handleChartSelectionChange = () => { this.toolViewApi.logger.info('Chart selection has changed'); } The method uses an arrow function expression , which binds the function so that the value of this is always ToolView1Component . Reload the i2 Notebook web client and open the browser console. As you change the selection on the chart, you should see messages from your tool view: \" My i2 Notebook plug-in Chart selection has changed\". The chartselectionchange event provides the current selection in its payload. Change the implementation of handleChartSelectionChange() to take the label from the first record in the selection and display it in the tool view: Still in tool-view1.component.ts , add the chart and records namespaces from the @i2analyze/notebook-sdk package to the existing import statement: import type { toolview, chart, records } from '@i2analyze/notebook-sdk'; Create a recordLabel property in the ToolView1Component class: public recordLabel = ''; Change handleChartSelectionChange() as follows, and add setValuesForRecord() : private handleChartSelectionChange: chart.SelectionListener = (selection) => { const record = selection.records.firstOrDefault(undefined); this.setValuesForRecord(record); } private setValuesForRecord(record: records.IChartRecord | undefined) { if (record) { this.recordLabel = record.labelOrFallback; } else { this.recordLabel = 'No records selected.'; } }; The firstOrDefault function returns the first record from the selection, falling back to the specified undefined if there isn't a first record. The labelOrFallback property reads the label of the record, falling back to a standard string if empty. Now we'll display the extracted record label. Replace the contents of src/app/tool-view1/tool-view1.component.html with: <div> <h1 class=\"record-header\">{{ recordLabel }}</h1> </div> Note: This and later HTML code uses CSS classes to apply styling to the tool view. To add the classes to your project, replace the file that Angular generated at src/app/tool-view1/tool-view1.component.css with its equivalent from Github . Reload the i2 Notebook web client, open the tool view, and select something on the chart. The tool view does not display the label, because the selection change event occurred outside Angular's change detection. We need to alert Angular that the state of our component has changed. Within tool-view1.component.ts : Add ChangeDetectorRef to the import from @angular/core : import { Component, OnInit, ChangeDetectorRef } from '@angular/core'; Inject the class into our component via the constructor: constructor(service: ToolViewApiService, private readonly changeDetectorRef: ChangeDetectorRef) { this.toolViewApi = service.getApi(); } After setting the recordLabel in setValuesForRecord() , alert Angular to the changes: this.changeDetectorRef.detectChanges(); Try the tool view again. Click around on the chart, selecting different items. It does now display the label of the first record in the chart selection, but there's still a problem. Close the tool view, select an item on the chart, and then open the tool view again. Notice that when the tool view opens , it's not displaying the record label. After you change the selection, the tool view does display the label correctly, but it's not displaying correctly at startup. The problem is that we're only setting the recordLabel field after a chartselectionchange event is received. Adding the dispatchNow option to the addEventListener subscription arranges for the chartselectionchange handler to be called immediately. In tool-view1.component.ts , inside the ngOnInit() method addEventListener call, add a dispatchNow: true option: ngOnInit(): void { this.toolViewApi.addEventListener( 'chartselectionchange', this.handleChartSelectionChange, { dispatchNow: true } ); } Reload the web client again, select an item, and open the tool view. This time, it immediately displays the label of the first selected record (or our \"No records selected.\" message) without waiting for a selection change. Display property data We have the record label, but we can build up our tool view to display data from more record properties. In tool-view1.component.ts , add data to the import from @i2analyze/notebook-sdk : import type { toolview, chart, records, data } from '@i2analyze/notebook-sdk'; Declare an interface that represents how we'll display the properties that we're going to retrieve: interface IProperty { label: string; value: string; } Next, add a property to the ToolView1Component that will store the record property information: public properties: IProperty[] = []; And edit setValuesForRecord() to extract property as well as label information from the record: private setValuesForRecord(record: records.IChartRecord | undefined) { const formatter = this.toolViewApi.formatter; if (record) { this.recordLabel = record.labelOrFallback; const properties: IProperty[] = []; for (const propertyType of record.itemType.propertyTypes) { const label = propertyType.displayName; const value = record.getProperty(propertyType); if (value !== undefined && !record.isValueUnfetched(value)) { const formattedValue = formatter.formatValue(value); properties.push({ label, value: formattedValue }); } } this.properties = properties; } else { this.recordLabel = 'No records selected.'; this.properties = []; } this.changeDetectorRef.detectChanges(); }; The record.getProperty() method can return values of type undefined , data.IValueNotFetched , or data.PropertyValue : An undefined value indicates that the record has no value for the specified property type. A not-fetched property value ( data.IValueNotFetched ) indicates that the record does have a value for the property, but we don't have that value in the client at the moment. Note: You can ensure that the property is fetched by using the chart.ensurePropertiesFetched() method. A property value ( data.PropertyValue ) can be an object representing any of the legal data types in the schema. It might be a string, or a number, or a more complicated object such as a date, time, date-time, decimal, or geospatial structure. Angular cannot directly render any of these structures, so we use the formatter.formatValue() method to produce standard i2 Notebook string representations of them. When we have a record, we filter out the undefined and not-fetched properties before displaying the remainder in our tool view. When we have no record at all, we set the properties to be an empty array. In tool-view1.component.html , add some elements to display the property data after the record label: <div> <h1 class=\"record-header\">{{ recordLabel }}</h1> <div class=\"record-properties\"> <div *ngFor=\"let property of properties\" class=\"property\"> <div class=\"property-label\">{{ property.label }}</div> <div class=\"property-value\">{{ property.value }}</div> </div> </div> </div> Reload the i2 Notebook web client and try out the tool view. Property values are now displayed, and numbers, dates, and times are formatted the same as in the rest of the application. Display an image and a link to more information So far, our tool view displays the label of a selected record and its property values. In this section, we'll go further by displaying an image to represent the record, and by linking to its 360 view (if it has one). First, in tool-view1.component.ts , add properties on the ToolView1Component class to store the image and the URL: public threeSixtyUrl?: string; public image?: data.IImage; In the setValuesForRecord() method, set these properties if we have a record, and clear them if we don't: if (record) { this.recordLabel = record.labelOrFallback; this.threeSixtyUrl = record.get360ViewUrl(); this.image = record.image || (record.isEntity() ? record.itemType.image : undefined); ... } else { this.recordLabel = 'No records selected.'; this.threeSixtyUrl = undefined; this.image = undefined; ... } This code uses the record image if one exists, and falls back to the image associated with the record's item type if it does not. In tool-view1.component.html , edit the heading to display the image and the link (if it exists): <h1 class=\"record-header\"> <img *ngIf=\"image\" [src]=\"image.href\" [alt]=\"image.description\" class=\"record-image\" /> <span class=\"record-label\"> <a *ngIf=\"threeSixtyUrl; else elseblock\" [href]=\"threeSixtyUrl\" target=\"_blank\"> {{ recordLabel }} </a> <ng-template #elseblock> {{ recordLabel }} </ng-template> </span> </h1> The target=\"_blank\" attribute on the <a> element is so that the view opens in a new browser tab or window, rather than in the tool view! Reload the i2 Notebook web client once again, and watch the behavior of the tool view: For entity records that came from the Information Store, the label is now also a hyperlink. For all records that have images, the tool view displays that image. Support globalization Not all users speak English, and not all languages are read from left to right. If your tool view is aimed internationally, it should flow and display its contents correctly in all locales. The i2 Notebook Web API includes support for dealing with localization. First, let's demonstrate one of the problems by simulating an Arabic locale. In your browser address bar, after the contextpath part of the address, add the query parameter ?translationLocale=ar-sa and reload the page. (For example, http://localhost:4000/opal/?translationLocale=ar-sa#charts ) The i2 Notebook web client responds by simulating the locale of Arabic (Saudi Arabia). Note: The web client actually provides two locales: the translationLocale , which is used for the translation of the text; and the formattingLocale , which is used for formatting data for display. The ?translationLocale query parameter simulates both the translation and the formatting locale. If you display the built-in Record Inspector tool (using the R keyboard shortcut), you'll see how its user interface now flows from right to left. When you open your tool view, however, it still flows from left to right. The API can provide the information that we need. We just have to use it in the right place! In src/app/app.component.ts , inside the AppComponent class: Add a property for the flowDirection : public readonly flowDirection: string; Use the tool view API to set flowDirection in the constructor of AppComponent : this.flowDirection = toolViewApi.locale.flowDirection; The flowDirection property has either the value ltr or rtl , which is perfect for use with the dir HTML attribute. In app.component.html , use flowDirection to set the dir attribute on the container: <div [ngClass]=\"{ 'light-theme': !isDarkTheme, 'dark-theme': isDarkTheme }\" [dir]=\"flowDirection\" > <app-tool-view1></app-tool-view1> </div> Reload the i2 Notebook web client and display the tool view again. It's laid out correctly according to the locale. When you add and remove the ?translationLocale=ar-sa query parameter, the flow alternates between left-to-right and right-to-left behavior. Note: By using the built-in formatter for property values, we get date, time, and numeric formatting for the Arabic (Saudi Arabia) locale automatically. Select items on your chart that have date, time, or numeric properties to see this in action. Another globalization issue is the text in the tool view. When simulating the Arabic (Saudi Arabia) locale, the \"No records selected.\" text doesn't display correctly - it actually displays as \".No records selected\". This problem occurs because the browser is trying to lay out the text from right to left, but it doesn't realize that the \".\" is meant to flow with the text, and shouldn't be considered by itself. (This issue affects most punctuation characters and numbers that aren't considered to be \"left-to-right\" or \"right-to-left\", but instead take their directionality from the context around them.) To get the text to behave correctly, we need to mark it up with bidirectional characters. Once again, we can use the formatter from the tool view API. Inside src/app/tool-view1/tool-view1.component.ts , find the implementation of ToolView1Component . When we set the record label, we'll use the formatter to wrap it with bidirectional characters: ... this.recordLabel = formatter.wrapForBidi(record.labelOrFallback, 'raw'); ... this.recordLabel = formatter.wrapForBidi('No records selected.', 'raw'); Reload the i2 Notebook web client, and continue to simulate the Arabic (Saudi Arabia) locale. The text is now wrapped correctly, and displays with the period at the end of the text as \"No records selected.\" In general, you should use wrapForBidi() for all read-only text that you display to the user. It's particularly important for text whose contents you don't know in advance because it comes from record data. Update the plug-in code to use wrapForBidi() throughout ToolView1Component . In tool-view1.component.ts , the setValuesForRecord() function becomes: private setValuesForRecord(record: records.IChartRecord | undefined) { const formatter = this.toolViewApi.formatter; if (record) { this.recordLabel = formatter.wrapForBidi(record.labelOrFallback, 'raw'); this.threeSixtyUrl = record.get360ViewUrl(); this.image = record.image || (record.isEntity() ? record.itemType.image : undefined); const properties: IProperty[] = []; for (const propertyType of record.itemType.propertyTypes) { const label = formatter.wrapForBidi(propertyType.displayName, 'raw'); const value = record.getProperty(propertyType); if (value !== undefined && !record.isValueUnfetched(value)) { const formattedValue = formatter.formatValue(value); properties.push({ label, value: formatter.wrapForBidi(formattedValue, 'raw'), }); } } this.properties = properties; } else { this.recordLabel = formatter.wrapForBidi('No records selected.', 'raw'); this.threeSixtyUrl = undefined; this.image = undefined; this.properties = []; } this.changeDetectorRef.detectChanges(); }; A further consideration for good globalization is that some images and icons should be reversed in right-to-left locales, while others should not. For example, back and forward navigation buttons should always be mirrored. For more information on this and other topics, consult a resource such as https://material.io/design/usability/bidirectionality.html#mirroring-elements . Before you continue with this tutorial, remove the ?translationLocale=ar-sa query parameter to stop simulating the Arabic (Saudi Arabia) locale. Add record navigation to the tool view So far, we have looked only at the first record in the selection, which is useful in an example but not realistic. Now let's look at all the records in the selection, and provide the user with a pair of buttons to page through those records and inspect their properties. As part of this work, we'll demonstrate what errors can occur if you access the data incorrectly, and then show you how to access the data correctly. In tool-view1.component.ts , add properties for the index of the current record, the total number of records, and the current selection to the ToolView1Component class: public currentRecordIndex = 0; public totalRecords = 0; private selection?: chart.ISelection; We'll store the selection and choose a record based on currentRecordIndex . Replace the implementation of handleChartSelectionChange() with the following code: private handleChartSelectionChange: chart.SelectionListener = (selection) => { this.selection = selection; this.currentRecordIndex = 0; this.totalRecords = selection.records.size; this.readDataForCurrentRecord(); }; private readDataForCurrentRecord() { const record = this.totalRecords && this.selection ? Array.from(this.selection.records)[this.currentRecordIndex] : undefined; this.setValuesForRecord(record); } Here, we've extracted the code that reads the record data and saves it in our component to a separate method named readDataForCurrentRecord() . We are now saving the selection and resetting the currentRecordIndex on every chart selection change. Next, we're going to move the responsibility for reporting a lack of records from the record display to a title area. In the setValuesForRecord() method, replace this code: this.recordLabel = formatter.wrapForBidi('No records selected.', 'raw'); with: this.recordLabel = ''; Add handler methods to update the currentRecordIndex and set the new record data; properties to indicate when the \"previous\" and \"next\" buttons are disabled; and a property named currentRecord that formats the current record index for display. Still in ToolView1Component , add: public onPreviousButtonClick = () => { this.currentRecordIndex--; this.readDataForCurrentRecord(); }; public onNextButtonClick = () => { this.currentRecordIndex++; this.readDataForCurrentRecord(); }; public get disablePreviousButton(): boolean { return this.currentRecordIndex === 0; } public get disableNextButton(): boolean { return this.currentRecordIndex === this.totalRecords - 1; } public get currentRecord(): number { return this.currentRecordIndex + 1; } In the same class, add a computed navigationTitle property: public get navigationTitle() { const formatter = this.toolViewApi.formatter; if (this.totalRecords === 0) { return formatter.wrapForBidi('No records selected.', 'raw'); } const currentRecord = formatter.formatValue(this.currentRecord); const totalRecords = formatter.formatValue(this.totalRecords); return formatter.wrapForBidi( `Record ${currentRecord} of ${totalRecords}`, 'raw' ); } This code creates a title with formatted numbers for the selected record and the total record count. In tool-view1.component.html , above the <h1> element, add the title and our navigation buttons: <div class=\"record-navigation\"> <div>{{ navigationTitle }}</div> <div class=\"navigation-buttons\" *ngIf=\"totalRecords\"> <button class=\"navigation-button\" (click)=\"onPreviousButtonClick()\" title=\"Previous record\" [disabled]=\"disablePreviousButton\" > &lt; </button> <button class=\"navigation-button\" (click)=\"onNextButtonClick()\" title=\"Next record\" [disabled]=\"disableNextButton\" > &gt; </button> </div> </div> This gives users a pair of buttons for changing the current record, and a title displaying which record they're viewing out of the total. It hides the buttons if there are no records selected. Reload the i2 Notebook web client and open the plug-in. You'll see the title and the buttons that we added. As you change the selection on the chart, the plug-in reflects the contents of the whole selection, not just its first record. Now, try changing the current record in the tool view by clicking the Next button. It doesn't work. If you look in the console, you'll see an error message: Application and chart data MUST only be accessed during event listener or transaction listener callbacks. It is not safe to access data at any other time. We are trying to access data outside an event or transaction listener. We store the selection data in our component, and attempt to read it when the user clicks Next . Let's see what happens if we store the records , instead of the whole selection. In tool-view1.component.ts : Remove the selection property from the ToolView1Component class, and replace it with a records property: private records?: data.IKeyedReadOnlyCollection<records.AnalyzeRecordId, records.IChartRecord>; Inside handleChartSelectionChange() , store the records instead of the selection: this.records = selection.records; Inside readDataForCurrentRecord() , change the declaration of the record variable to: const record = this.totalRecords && this.records ? Array.from(this.records)[this.currentRecordIndex] : undefined; Reload the i2 Notebook web client and try again. It still doesn't work. It doesn't matter if you're storing the selection or the records. You cannot access i2 Notebook chart data outside an event, mutation, or transaction listener. This rule ensures that API consumers always see a consistent view of the application data. Whenever you want to read data outside an event handler, you must request access to it from the application through a transaction or a mutation. Remove the records property from the ToolView1Component class. Instead of storing them, we'll use the current record index to request the record that we want from the application. Change the handleChartSelectionChange() implementation to: private handleChartSelectionChange: chart.SelectionListener = () => { this.currentRecordIndex = 0; this.readDataForCurrentRecord(); }; Change the readDataForCurrentRecord() function so that it requests the record data from the tool view API in a transaction handler: private readDataForCurrentRecord() { this.toolViewApi.runTransaction((application) => { const records = application.chart.selection.records; const recordIds = Array.from(records.map((r) => r.id)); this.totalRecords = records.size; const currentRecordId = recordIds[this.currentRecordIndex]; const record = records.get(currentRecordId); this.setValuesForRecord(record); }); } It's safe to access chart data during the callback, and we take advantage by populating the component fields with data from the current record. Reload the i2 Notebook web client, select multiple items on the chart, and try using the buttons in our tool view to navigate among their records. Now, it works! Extension: Ensure fetched properties While viewing record properties, eventually a property will be shown as Exists but not fetched . You can ensure that the property is fetched. Change the readDataForCurrentRecord() function so that it ensures all properties are fetched before setting the values for records: private readDataForCurrentRecord() { this.toolViewApi.runTransaction(async(application) => { const records = application.chart.selection.records; const recordIds = Array.from(records.map((r) => r.id)); this.totalRecords = records.size; const currentRecordId = recordIds[this.currentRecordIndex]; const record = records.get(currentRecordId); if (record) { const propertyTypes = record.itemType.propertyTypes; await application.chart.ensurePropertiesFetched(record, propertyTypes); } this.setValuesForRecord(record); }); } Store and restore state when the tool view is floated and docked Our tool view is almost complete, but for now there are still problems to solve. For example, you can select multiple items on the chart surface, and navigate to the second record in the selection by clicking Next . But if you then float the tool view, it returns to showing the first record again. When a tool view is docked or floated, its user interface is completely recreated in a different browser window, causing all of its temporary state to be lost. To address this, we can make use of the volatile store that's available from the tool view API. This store allows us to store state so that it survives tool view re-creation. (It's called the \"volatile\" store because its state does not persist across application reloads.) In tool-view1.component.ts , at the end of the ngOnInit() method, just after we subscribe to the chartselectionchange event, add some state persistence logic: ngOnInit(): void { ... this.toolViewApi.addEventListener('unload', () => { this.toolViewApi.volatileStore.set( 'currentRecordIndex', this.currentRecordIndex ); }); this.currentRecordIndex = this.toolViewApi.volatileStore.get('currentRecordIndex') || 0; this.readDataForCurrentRecord(); } This code means that we store currentRecordIndex when the tool view is unloaded, and retrieve it from the volatile store when the tool view is initialized. Because we're now fetching data immediately when the tool view starts up, we no longer need to use the dispatchNow option for the chartselectionchange event handler in ngOnInit() . Remove it, leaving the event subscription as follows: this.toolViewApi.addEventListener('chartselectionchange', this.handleChartSelectionChange); The tool view now correctly maintains its state across docking and floating operations. Clear state when the tool view is closed We're now preserving the tool view state across floating and docking operations. However, we're also preserving that state if the user explicitly closes the tool view, which isn't appropriate. When the user closes the tool view, we should reset the state. The unload event can tell us whether the tool view is being unloaded because of an explicit close operation. In tool-view1.component.ts , inside the ngOnInit() method, change the unload event handler to: this.toolViewApi.addEventListener('unload', (isClosing) => { if (isClosing) { this.toolViewApi.volatileStore.clear(); } else { this.toolViewApi.volatileStore.set('currentRecordIndex', this.currentRecordIndex); } }); Now, if the tool view is being closed, we'll discard our state. Otherwise, we'll persist it. Reload the i2 Notebook web client to test the changes we've made. Closing the tool view will reset the record index. Replace the built-in Record Inspector with our tool view We now have a functional tool view that allows users to view some of the details of a record. We can even use it to replace the web client's built-in Record Inspector! Removing the Record Inspector is easy. Edit src/entrypoint.js to insert the following command-removal code just before the call to initializationComplete() : api.commands.removeCommand(api.commands.systemCommands.toggleRecordInspector); Change the tool view toggle command name to \"Record inspector plug-in\", and add a keyboardHelp section so that the tool can be opened using a keyboard shortcut: const toggle = api.commands.createToolViewToggleCommand( { id: '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000003', name: 'Record inspector plug-in', icon: { type: 'inlineSvg', svg: '<svg viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><circle cx=\"8\" cy=\"8\" r=\"4\" /></svg>', }, keyboardHelp: { category: 'discover', label: 'Toggle record inspector plug-in', keys: ['shift+r'], }, }, toolView ); Reload the i2 Notebook web client, and you should see that: The built-in \"Record Inspector\" tool has been removed. The keyboard help dialog (displayed by pressing \"h\") lists the keyboard shortcut Shift+R for our tool view. Using the keyboard shortcut shift+r also toggles our tool view. Deploy the plug-in To deploy our plug-in on the server, we first need to build it by running: npm run build from the plugin-ng directory. This creates a production build of our tutorial plug-in inside dist/plugin-ng . For the actual deployment, we need to add the built plug-in to the server configuration, and then redeploy the server. Note: If you follow this procedure in a deployment that provides high availability, you must complete each step on every Liberty server in your environment before you move to the next step. On the server that hosts the i2 Analyze deployment, find the toolkit/configuration directory, and then navigate to the fragments/opal-services directory that it contains. If the opal-services directory does not already contain a plugins subdirectory, create one. Copy the dist/plugin-ng directory into the plugins directory, to create plugins/plugin-ng . Run the following toolkit commands to update the deployed i2 Analyze server: setup -t stopLiberty setup -t deployLiberty setup -t startLiberty Stop the development proxy, and use the browser to navigate to your real server address. You'll find that your plug-in was successfully deployed. Next steps In this tutorial, we've: Created a command to show a record's position on a map, and added that command to the application ribbon and the chart pop-up menu Created a tool view to display record data, and replaced the built-in Record Inspector with this new tool view Considered data access, formatting, and globalization Deployed our plug-in on the i2 Analyze server This is just a flavor of what you can do with the @i2analyze/notebook-sdk package. To understand more about the capabilities of the i2 Notebook Web API, see the rest of the SDK documentation."

    "keywords": "Creating a basic plug-in for the i2 Notebook web client This tutorial takes you through creating a basic plug-in for the i2 Notebook web client that can take geospatial data from records on a chart and visualize it on a map outside of the application. Note: The external mapping functionality that the plug-in provides is completely separate from the i2 Notebook web client's built-in Maps feature. The plug-in adds commands to the user interface for users to interact with, but unlike the more complex plug-ins that you might create later, it does not display a user interface of its own. Other tutorials in the SDK describe how to create a plug-in with a user interface, using a number of popular frameworks: Angular React Vue This tutorial is not a prerequisite for any of the three that are listed above. You can find a full version of the source code for this tutorial in the samples/basic-plugin folder. Prerequisites This tutorial requires a running instance of i2 Analyze on which you have permission to use the i2 Notebook web client. To follow the tutorial, you must install at least version 12 of Node.js on your development machine. For downloads and more information about Node.js, visit the project website at https://nodejs.org . The tutorial also requires you to create GUIDs for a number of its elements. The project files use some sample fixed GUIDs ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 , 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002 , and so on), but you should always create real GUIDs for real projects. Note: A suitable GUID generator is available online at https://www.guidgenerator.com . Create a basic plug-in A basic i2 Notebook plug-in has the same requirements as a more complex one: in the plug-in directory, you must create the manifest and the entry point that enable the i2 Notebook web client to load and integrate your plug-in. The first part of this tutorial covers those requirements, and also explains how to set up both your development environment and a local Node.js server. Create a directory for your plug-in. For example, plugin . In the new directory, use an IDE such as VSCode to create a package.json file that describes the plug-in project: { \"name\": \"plugin\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"scripts\": {} } On the command line, navigate to the project directory and add the i2 Notebook SDK package to the project: npm install @i2analyze/notebook-sdk The package contains a type library that enables inline assistance in your IDE. To set up auto-completion and other assistance, create and populate a file named jsconfig.json in the same directory: { \"compilerOptions\": { \"checkJs\": true, \"lib\": [\"es2020\", \"dom\"], \"target\": \"es2018\", \"types\": [\"@i2analyze/notebook-sdk\"], \"moduleResolution\": \"node\", \"strict\": true }, \"exclude\": [\"node_modules\", \"**/node_modules\"] } Note: For more information about the jsconfig.json file, see the Microsoft Visual Studio Code documentation . Now you're in position to write the plug-in itself, starting with the manifest. Create a file named plugin.json , with the following contents: { \"$schema\": \"https://i2group.github.io/notebook-sdk/schemas/plugin-manifest.json\" } The schema enforces the structure and content of the file. For more information, see the plug-in manifest documentation. Continue to populate the manifest with values for \"name\" , \"pluginId\" , and \"pluginVersion\" ; and set \"entryPointUrl\" to \"./entrypoint.js\" . For example: \"name\": \"My plug-in\", \"pluginId\": \"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001\", \"pluginVersion\": \"1.0.0\", \"entryPointUrl\": \"./entrypoint.js\" Next, we can create the entry point. Add a file named entrypoint.js to the plug-in directory, and populate it: async function main() { const api = await notebook.getEntryPointApi('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001', '1.1'); api.logger.info('Plug-in running'); api.initializationComplete(); } void main(); Through this code, the plug-in retrieves the version of the entry point API that it wants to use, and uses it to declare that it has finished initializing. The GUID here must match the one in the plug-in manifest. If you enter the code by hand, you'll see how the type library provides auto-completion as you go. Back on the command line, add the serve package as a development dependency: npm install -D serve Add a script to the package.json file to serve the project. For example: \"scripts\": { \"start\": \"serve -l 5001\" } Start the project by running npm start . Finally, navigate to the URL where the project is being hosted ( http://localhost:5001/ , if you used the example) and confirm that plugin.json and entrypoint.js are served correctly. Test the plug-in in the i2 Notebook web client As we're developing and testing a plug-in, we won't deploy the plug-in directly to the i2 Analyze server. Instead, we'll use the i2 Notebook SDK plug-in development proxy to add our plug-in to an existing i2 Notebook deployment without needing to modify it. Anywhere on your workstation, create and populate a file named devproxy.json : { \"$schema\": \"https://i2group.github.io/notebook-sdk/schemas/devproxy.json\" } This forms the basis of the configuration file for the development proxy. Add a value for \"server\" that is the URL of an existing i2 Analyze deployment. For example, \"http://localhost:9082/opal/\" . Add a value for \"port\" to specify the port that the development proxy should listen on. For example, 4000 . Add a value for \"plugins\" that contains the root URL of your plug-in. For example, [\"http://localhost:5001/\"] for the server that we configured above. On the command line, navigate to the folder that contains the configuration file, and run the i2 Notebook plug-in development proxy (no installation is required): npx @i2analyze/notebook-sdk-plugin-proxy --config devproxy.json Open the proxy URL in a browser and log in to the i2 Notebook web client. For example, http://localhost:4000/opal/ . Open the browser's developer console and check for our plug-in's message being logged: My plug-in Plug-in running If you see this message, then the plug-in is working correctly. Add a ribbon command to the plug-in So far, you have a plug-in that's being loaded into the i2 Notebook web client - but it doesn't do anything. Next, we'll make the plug-in add a command to the application ribbon that opens geospatial locations in Google Maps. In entrypoint.js , just before the call to initializationComplete() , create a command: const viewOnMap = api.commands.createCommand({ id: '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002', name: 'View on map', type: 'records', icon: { type: 'inlineSvg', svg: '<svg viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><rect width=\"8\" height=\"8\" x=\"4\" y=\"4\"/></svg>', }, onExecute(payload) {}, }); Straight afterward, surface the command on the ribbon's Home tab, just after the Information Store group: api.commands.applicationRibbon.homeTab .after(api.commands.applicationRibbon.homeTab.systemGroups.searchInfoStore) .surfaceCommands(viewOnMap); Reload i2 Notebook and check that the action is visible in the application ribbon. Clicking the button won't do anything yet because we haven't implemented onExecute() , so let's do that now. Create this helper function at the top level of the entrypoint.js file: /** * @param {import(\"@i2analyze/notebook-sdk\").data.IReadOnlyCollection<import(\"@i2analyze/notebook-sdk\").records.IChartRecord>} records */ function findGeospatialValue(records) { for (const record of records) { for (const propertyType of record.itemType.propertyTypes) { if (propertyType.logicalType === 'geospatial') { const property = record.getProperty(propertyType); if (property !== undefined && !record.isValueUnfetched(property)) { return /** @type {import(\"@i2analyze/notebook-sdk\").data.IGeoPoint} */ (property); } } } } return undefined; } This function performs a simple scan of the records it receives, looking for a non-empty geospatial property that it returns if it finds one. Note: The /** @type {import...} */ and /** @param {import...} */ code helps the JavaScript type system to understand what we're working with, which enables auto-completion in the rest of the code. If we used TypeScript to create our entrypoint.js file, we'd use import type statements instead. We can now use the helper function in the implementation of onExecute() that we left empty in the call to CreateCommand() . We'll take the latitude and longitude to a new Google Maps window: onExecute(payload) { const property = findGeospatialValue(payload.records); if (!property) { return; } window.open( `https://www.google.com/maps/@${property.latitude},${property.longitude},18z`, \"_blank\" ); }, Reload i2 Notebook again, select an element with a geospatial property, and try the command. Google Maps should open at the relevant location. Make the command sensitive to selection There's a problem with our command: the button is enabled even if the selection doesn't actually contain a geospatial property. That would be misleading for a user, but we can fix it by taking control of the surfacing of the command in the user interface. After the onExecute() parameter to createCommand() , add an onSurface() function definition: onSurface(action, eventApi, signal) { eventApi.addEventListener( \"recordscontextchange\", (context) => { action.setEnabled(!!findGeospatialValue(context.records)); }, { dispatchNow: true, signal } ); }, There are a few things to notice here: i2 Notebook calls our onSurface() function with an action object that represents the user interface control to which the command is bound each time it is surfaced. A single command might be surfaced in several places, and you can use the action object to react differently in each of them. The function also receives an eventApi object through which it can listen to changes in the records to which the action is being applied; and a signal object that indicates when this particular surfacing of the command is being removed. In our implementation, we subscribe to the recordscontextchange event, which tells us when the current records change. When they do change, we set the enabled state of the action to a value based on whether there is a geospatial value in the current records. Event listeners are normally invoked when the event occurs. However, we don't want to wait for a recordscontextchange event before we run our setEnabled() code, so we specify dispatchNow: true to invoke the callback immediately, without waiting for the event. This in turn causes our action to be enabled or disabled correctly, right away. We forward the signal to the event listener so that it unsubscribes automatically from the recordscontextchange event when the action is unsurfaced. Reload i2 Notebook. The button in the application ribbon is now enabled only when a geospatial property exists in the selection. Use the command in more than one place As well as adding it to the ribbon, we can add exactly the same command to the chart pop-up menu with a single line of code. After the existing call to surfaceCommands() , add: api.commands.chartPopupMenu.surfaceCommands(viewOnMap); Reload i2 Notebook. The same command, with the same enablement rules, is now present in the chart's pop-up menu. Deploy the plug-in To deploy our plug-in on the server, we need to add it to the server configuration, and then redeploy the server. Note: If you follow this procedure in a deployment that provides high availability, you must complete each step on every Liberty server in your environment before you move to the next step. On the server that hosts the i2 Analyze deployment, find the toolkit/configuration directory, and then navigate to the fragments/opal-services directory that it contains. If the opal-services directory does not already contain a plugins subdirectory, create one. Create a directory for our plug-in inside the plugins directory (for example, plugins/plugin-basic ), and copy the entrypoint.js and plugin.json files into it. Run the following toolkit commands to update the deployed i2 Analyze server: setup -t stopLiberty setup -t deployLiberty setup -t startLiberty Stop the development proxy, and use the browser to navigate to your real server address. You'll find that your plug-in was successfully deployed. Next steps By following the procedure in this tutorial, you've created an i2 Notebook plug-in that, though basic, is fully integrated with the application. It displays actions in the user interface, it responds to changes in selection, and it sends data from chart records to an external application. Most real plug-ins go further than this one by adding a tool view that presents users with a custom interface for performing more complex tasks. You can see the fundamentals of how tool views work by following one of the examples that use popular UI frameworks to implement a tool view."

You can find a full version of the source code for this tutorial in the samples/color-plugin folder. Prerequisities This tutorial requires a running instance of i2 Analyze on which you have permission to use the i2 Notebook web client. To follow the tutorial, you must install at least version 12 of Node.js on your development machine. For downloads and more information about Node.js, visit the project website at https://nodejs.org . The tutorial also requires you to create GUIDs for a number of its elements. The project files use some sample fixed GUIDs ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 , 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002 , and so on), but you should always create real GUIDs for real projects. Note: A suitable GUID generator is available online at https://www.guidgenerator.com . Create a basic plug-in To arrive at the starting point for this tutorial, follow the instructions in the basic plug-in tutorial , up to but not including the section named Add a ribbon command to the plug-in . In entrypoint.js , change the requested API version to 1.2 : const api = await notebook.getEntryPointApi('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001', '1.2'); Make sure that you have a working plug-in before you continue. Add a ribbon command Starting from the essentially empty plug-in, we'll add a new command to the ribbon that will eventually change the color of nodes that contain vehicle records to the colors of those vehicles. In entrypoint.js , just before the call to initializationComplete() , create a command and surface it on the Home tab: const colorVehicleNodes = api.commands.createCommand({ id: '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002', name: 'Color vehicle nodes', type: 'application', icon: { type: 'inlineSvg', svg: '<svg viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><rect width=\"8\" height=\"8\" x=\"4\" y=\"4\"/></svg>', }, onExecute() {}, }); const homeTab = api.commands.applicationRibbon.homeTab; const searchInfoStoreCommand = homeTab.systemGroups.searchInfoStore; homeTab.after(searchInfoStoreCommand).surfaceCommands(colorVehicleNodes); So far, this command is almost identical to the one that you would have added, if you had continued with the basic plug-in tutorial. Reload i2 Notebook and check that the command is visible in the application ribbon. Set node colors To set the color of a node, we'll use a mutation (see Supported mutation operations ) that requires the NodeSpecifier of the node, and the color to change the node to. In the sections that follow, we will: Find all records of the vehicle entity type on the chart. Retrieve the color of the vehicle from each vehicle record. Set each vehicle record's node element to the color of the vehicle. Find all vehicle records on the chart Elements on the chart surface are defined by and contain records that store data (see Record data ). We can gain access to the chart and all the entity records via the argument of type app.IApplicationContents passed to the onExecute() event handler. To determine whether a record has a particular type, we need to specify which type we're looking for! We'll search the item types in the chart's schema object (see Schema data ) for the one that corresponds to vehicle records. Specify the type identifier of the vehicle item type in the i2 Analyze schema. Access the chart schema through the onExecute() application contents parameter, and get the chart item type that corresponds to that type identifier. Access all of the chart entityRecords through the onExecute() application contents parameter. Find the records with the vehicle item type. If there are no vehicle records, just return. const vehicleAnalyzeTypeId = 'ET3'; ... onExecute(applicationContents) { const vehicleItemType = applicationContents.chart.schema.getItemType(vehicleAnalyzeTypeId); const allEntityRecords = applicationContents.chart.entityRecords; const vehicleRecords = allEntityRecords.filter( (record) => record.itemType === vehicleItemType ); }, ... At this point, we now have all the vehicle type entity records, and we're ready to retrieve the color property for each record. Retrieve a color from each vehicle record We will now find the color for each vehicle. Instead of accessing the item types in the schema , we'll need to access the property types in the vehicle item type. Specify the type identifier of the color property type of the vehicle item type. Use the vehicleItemType object to get the property type that corresponds to that type identifier. Gain access to mutations by calling api.runTrackedMutations() and setting a handler function. Inside the mutation handler, loop over every vehicle entity record. Use the color property type to retrieve the color of the vehicle that the record represents. const vehicleColorAnalyzeTypeId = 'VEH9'; ... const colorPropertyType = vehicleItemType.getPropertyType(vehicleColorAnalyzeTypeId); api.runTrackedMutations((_, mutations) => { for (const vehicleRecord of vehicleRecords) { const vehicleColor = vehicleRecord.getProperty(colorPropertyType); ... Set the record's element to the color of the vehicle Finally, for each vehicle record we found, we'll use a mutation to set the color of the node element that contains it to the color of the vehicle. Retrieve the record's containing element using the element property. Use the mutations parameter to call the editNode() method, and then the setColor() method. Return an ITrackedMutationCommit object from the runTrackedMutations() method call. ... api.runTrackedMutations((_, mutations) => { for (const vehicleRecord of vehicleRecords) { const vehicleColor = vehicleRecord.getProperty(colorPropertyType); const vehicleElement = vehicleRecord.element; mutations.editNode(vehicleElement.id).setColor(vehicleColor?.toString()); } return { type: 'commit', actionDisplayName: 'Set vehicle node colors', }; }); ... Note: This implementation assumes that the vehicle color value in the record property is in a format that the setColor() method supports. Now, if a chart contains one or more nodes with a vehicle record, clicking the ribbon button changes the color of all those nodes to their vehicle color."

    "keywords": "Creating a production-ready plug-in with the Create Notebook Plug-in tool This tutorial takes you through creating a production-ready plug-in for the i2 Web Client using a project scaffold created with the create-notebook-plugin tool. Prerequisites To follow the tutorial, you must install at least version 18 of Node.js on your development machine. For downloads and more information about Node.js, visit the project website at https://nodejs.org . This tutorial also requires a running instance of i2 Analyze on which you have permission to use the i2 Web Client. Create a plug-in Run the following command on the command line: npm create @i2analyze/notebook-plugin This command installs and executes @i2analyze/create-notebook-plugin , a tool designed for the purpose of creating plug-in projects for the i2 Web Client. When you run the tool, you'll see a number of options. For now, use the default value for each option by pressing Enter at each prompt. $ create-notebook-plugin Plugin-name: (My plug-in): My plug-in Plugin-description: (My plug-in description): My plug-in description Server URL: (http://localhost:9082/opal): http://localhost:9082/opal Run git init?: (no) No Run npm install?: (no) No $ The tool creates a directory for the plug-in project whose name is derived from the name that you provide. With the default values, the directory is named my-plug-in . When the project is ready, run the following commands to install dependencies and start the development server and the plug-in proxy: cd my-plug-in npm install npm run dev The plug-in project is now running! In your browser, navigate to the Web Client at http://localhost:4000/opal/ and check that the plug-in has loaded correctly. Look for a new button in the application ribbon, and a new message in the developer tools console: My plug-in running If you see this message, then the plug-in is working correctly. The Create Notebook Plug-in tool configures the project folder for TypeScript, ESLint, and prettier. It also creates devproxy.json and plugin.json manifests, and adds scripts to allow for development and production builds. The latter use webpack to create a bundle that's deployable to an i2 Analyze server. Add a ribbon command to the plug-in At this stage, the plug-in sends some basic information to the browser's developer tools console, and adds a button that does nothing to the application ribbon. Next, we'll replace the generated code with some calls to the i2 Web Client API that modify the button to open geospatial locations in Google Maps. In src/entrypoint.ts , make the following changes. Change the first line from: import { NotebookStatic } from '@i2analyze/notebook-sdk'; to: import { commands, data, records, NotebookStatic } from '@i2analyze/notebook-sdk'; Change: name: 'My plug-in'; to: name: 'View on map'; In the createCommand() call, change: type: 'unscoped'; to: type: 'records'; And change: onExecute() { to: onExecute(payload: commands.IRecordsContext) { Create this helper function at the top level of the entrypoint.ts file: function findGeospatialValue(chartRecords: data.IReadOnlyCollection<records.IChartRecord>) { for (const record of chartRecords) { for (const propertyType of record.itemType.propertyTypes) { if (propertyType.logicalType === 'geospatial') { const property = record.getProperty(propertyType); if (property !== undefined && !record.isValueUnfetched(property)) { return property as data.IGeoPoint; } } } } return undefined; } This function performs a simple scan of the records that it receives, and returns the first non-empty geospatial property that it finds. We can now use the helper function in the implementation of onExecute() , replacing the default code that the project was created with. We'll take the latitude and longitude to a new Google Maps window: onExecute(payload: commands.IRecordsContext) { const property = findGeospatialValue(payload.records); if (!property) { return; } window.open( `https://www.google.com/maps/@${property.latitude},${property.longitude},18z`, \"_blank\" ); }, Reload the Web Client, select an element with a geospatial property, and try the command. Google Maps should open at the relevant location. Make the command sensitive to selection There's a problem with our command: The button is enabled even if the selection doesn't actually contain a geospatial property. That would be misleading for a user, but we can fix it by taking control of the surfacing of the command in the user interface. After the onExecute() parameter to createCommand() , replace the onSurface() function definition: onSurface(action, eventApi, signal) { eventApi.addEventListener( \"recordscontextchange\", (context) => { action.setEnabled(!!findGeospatialValue(context.records)); }, { dispatchNow: true, signal } ); }, There are a few things going on here: The Web Client calls our onSurface() function with an action object that represents the user interface control to which the command is bound each time it is surfaced. A single command might be surfaced in several places, and you can use the action object to react differently in each of them. The function also receives an eventApi object through which it can listen to changes in the records to which the action is being applied; and a signal object that indicates when this particular surfacing of the command is being removed. In our implementation, we subscribe to the recordscontextchange event, which tells us when the current records change. When they do change, we set the enabled state of the action to a value based on whether there is a geospatial value in the current records. Event listeners are normally invoked when the event occurs. However, we don't want to wait for a recordscontextchange event before we run our setEnabled() code, so we specify dispatchNow: true to invoke the callback immediately, without waiting for the event. This in turn causes our action to be enabled or disabled correctly, right away. We forward the signal to the event listener so that it unsubscribes automatically from the recordscontextchange event when the action is unsurfaced. Reload the Web Client. The button in the application ribbon is now enabled only when a geospatial property exists in the selection. Use the command in more than one place As well as adding it to the ribbon, we can add exactly the same command to the chart pop-up menu with a single line of code. After the existing call to surfaceCommands() , add: api.commands.chartPopupMenu.surfaceCommands(viewOnMap); Reload the Web Client. The same command, with the same enablement rules, is now present in the chart's pop-up menu. Deploy the plug-in To deploy our plug-in on the server, we should rebuild it ready for deployment using a production build. We then need to add it to the server configuration, and then redeploy the server. Note: If you follow this procedure in a deployment that provides high availability, you must complete each step on every Liberty server in your environment before you move to the next step. Build a production version of the plug-in by executing the following command: npm run build This compiles the plug-in and bundles it into a dist folder in the project. That folder contains everything that you need to copy to the server. On the server that hosts the i2 Analyze deployment, find the toolkit/configuration directory, and then navigate to the fragments/opal-services directory that it contains. If the opal-services directory does not already contain a plugins subdirectory, create one. Create a directory for your plug-in inside the plugins directory (for example, plugins/plugin-basic ), and copy the contents of the dist folder into this folder. Run the following toolkit commands to update the deployed i2 Analyze server: setup -t stopLiberty setup -t deployLiberty setup -t startLiberty Stop the development proxy, and use the browser to navigate to your real server address. You'll find that your plug-in was successfully deployed. Next steps By following the procedure in this tutorial, you've used the create-notebook-plugin tool to create an i2 Web Client plug-in that, though basic, is fully integrated with the application. It displays actions in the user interface, it responds to changes in selection, and it sends data from chart records to an external application. Most real plug-ins go further than this one by adding a tool view that presents users with a custom interface for performing more complex tasks. You can see the fundamentals of how tool views work by following one of the examples that use popular UI frameworks to implement a tool view. You can instruct create-notebook-plugin to create such a plug-in by specifying a template that uses React to implement a skeleton tool view: npm create @i2analyze/notebook-plugin -- --template=plugin-with-toolview"

    "title": "Adding item types",
    "keywords": "Adding item types When charting items from datasets, you may encounter situations where the item types available in the i2 Analyze server schema do not fully align with your data. The i2 Notebook SDK allows you to create custom item types and define properties tailored to your specific needs. This tutorial demonstrates how to add custom item types to the chart schema and listen for schema change events. It focuses on the core SDK APIs rather than UI implementation. The complete sample includes a simple interface (a textarea pre-populated with sample JSON data and a button) for demonstration purposes, but the tutorial concentrates on the key API usage. In practice, you would adapt these APIs to work with your own data sources and schema structures. You can find a full version of the source code for this tutorial in the samples/item-type-plugin folder. Prerequisites This tutorial requires: A running instance of i2 Analyze version 4.4.4.5 or later i2 Notebook SDK version 1.6 or later These versions introduced the functionalities discussed in this tutorial. Create a plug-in To get started, we'll use the @i2analyze/create-notebook-plugin package to quickly scaffold the plug-in structure. For a detailed walkthrough on creating a plug-in, refer to the Creating a production-ready plug-in with the Create Notebook Plug-in tool tutorial. Run the following command to create a plug-in with a tool view: npx @i2analyze/create-notebook-plugin --template=plugin-with-toolview This command initializes the plug-in and tool view, providing a foundation for development. Follow the prompts to configure your plug-in. Once the setup is complete, you will have a basic structure ready for further customization. Set up the SDK version Ensure that your project has the correct version of the SDK installed. In package.json , verify or update the dependency: { \"dependencies\": { \"@i2analyze/notebook-sdk\": \"^1.6.0\" } } After updating your dependencies, modify the entrypoint.ts file to request the correct API version: const api = await notebook.getEntryPointApi('ac7bcb47-f3d5-45c8-8d41-8ca30cf8ec06', '1.6'); Before proceeding, ensure that your plug-in is functioning correctly. Add item types To demonstrate how to add item types, we'll use example JSON data based on a wildlife crime seizure shipment scenario. This example shows the complete workflow: Define custom item types (entity and link types) with their properties Add these types to the chart schema Create records using the newly defined types The process requires two separate mutation operations: first adding the item types to the schema, then adding the actual records. Example JSON data { \"data\": [ { \"shipmentId\": \"S1-DEP\", \"typeId\": \"departure\", \"name\": \"Departure\", \"icon\": \"Cargo Plane (Rotary Wing)\", \"properties\": [ { \"type\": \"date\", \"name\": \"Departure Date\", \"value\": \"2023-10-01\" }, { \"type\": \"singleLineString\", \"name\": \"Country\", \"value\": \"Congo\" } ] }, { \"shipmentId\": \"S1-DES\", \"typeId\": \"destination\", \"name\": \"Destination\", \"icon\": \"Place\", \"properties\": [ { \"type\": \"date\", \"name\": \"Expected Arrival\", \"value\": \"2023-10-04\" }, { \"type\": \"singleLineString\", \"name\": \"Country\", \"value\": \"Vietnam\" } ] }, { \"typeId\": \"seizure\", \"name\": \"Seizure\", \"fromId\": \"S1-DEP\", \"toId\": \"S1-DES\", \"properties\": [ { \"type\": \"date\", \"name\": \"Seizure Date\", \"value\": \"2023-10-03\" }, { \"type\": \"singleLineString\", \"name\": \"Seizure Country\", \"value\": \"Singapore\" } ] } ] } To add item types, we'll create a function that iterates through each record and determines whether to add an entity or a link. A link type is identified by the presence of fromId and toId fields in the JSON data. The sample's ToolView.tsx contains an addItemTypes function that demonstrates this process, filtering out items whose types already exist in the schema to avoid duplicates: The helper function isLinkData() checks for the presence of fromId and toId fields. See the complete implementation in the sample code. const addItemTypes = (items: (IEntity | ILink)[]) => { toolViewApi.runTrackedMutations((application, mutations) => { // Filter items whose types are not already in the schema const filteredItems = items.filter((item) => { const foundItemType = application.chart.schema.itemTypes.find( (itemType) => itemType.displayName === item.name ); return !foundItemType; }); if (filteredItems.length === 0) { return { type: 'rollback' }; } for (const item of filteredItems) { if (isLinkData(item)) { mutations.addLinkType({ displayName: item.name, propertyTypes: item.properties.map((property) => ({ displayName: property.name, logicalType: property.type, isLabelPart: true, })), }); } else { mutations.addEntityType({ displayName: item.name, icon: item.icon, propertyTypes: item.properties.map((property) => ({ displayName: property.name, logicalType: property.type, isLabelPart: true, })), }); } } return { type: 'commit', actionDisplayName: 'Add item types', }; }); }; For adding an entity type, we use addEntityType() , which requires a displayName , an icon , and optional propertyTypes . For a link type, we use addLinkType() , which requires a displayName and optional propertyTypes . Each property type includes: displayName : The name shown in the UI logicalType : The data type (e.g., 'date' , 'singleLineString' ) isLabelPart : Whether this property appears in the record's label (only applicable for string-based types), non-string properties will throw an error. After running this function, you now have two entity types ( Departure and Destination ) and one link type ( Seizure ) added to the chart schema. Add records Once the item types are added, you can create new records using these item types. The following simplified example demonstrates the key concepts for creating both entity and link records: const addRecords = (items: (IEntity | ILink)[]) => { toolViewApi.runTrackedMutations((application, mutations) => { const pendingRecordMap = new Map<string, sdk.app.IPendingRecord>(); for (const item of items) { // Find the item type from the schema const itemType = application.chart.schema.itemTypes.find( (type) => type.displayName === item.name ); // Build properties array const properties: [sdk.schema.PropertyTypeSpecifier, sdk.data.PropertyValue][] = []; item.properties.forEach((property) => { const propertyType = itemType.propertyTypes.find((pt) => pt.displayName === property.name); if (propertyType) { let value: sdk.data.PropertyValue = property.value; // Convert date strings to LocalDate if (propertyType.logicalType === 'date') { const date = new Date(property.value); value = mutations.valueFactory.createLocalDate( date.getFullYear(), date.getMonth() + 1, date.getDate() ); } properties.push([propertyType, value]); } }); if (isLinkData(item)) { // Create a link record mutations.addLinkRecord({ itemType, fromEnd: pendingRecordMap.get(item.fromId).recordId, toEnd: pendingRecordMap.get(item.toId).recordId, linkDirection: 'none', properties, }); } else { // Create an entity record const pendingRecord = mutations.addEntityRecord({ itemType, properties, }); // Store for link record creation pendingRecordMap.set(item.shipmentId, pendingRecord); } } return { type: 'commit', actionDisplayName: 'Add records', }; }); }; This example focuses on the core SDK APIs: addEntityRecord() for creating entities and addLinkRecord() for creating links between them. For a complete implementation with proper error handling and validation, refer to ToolView.tsx in the sample code. Based on the example data, three records will be added to the chart: a Departure entity record, a Destination entity record, and a Seizure link record that connects them. Note: In this example, the item type is looked up from the schema by its name. However, it's recommended to use the typeId for lookups, as item types may share the same name. The typeId is always unique. When you add an item type, the API returns a schema.IPendingItemType object, which provides access to the typeId . Using this unique identifier ensures reliable and consistent lookups, even if item names are duplicated. Listen for chart schema change events When using runTrackedMutations() , if the mutation alters the schema, you can listen for chart schema changes in the mutation response handler. toolViewApi.runTrackedMutations( (application, mutations) => { // Perform mutations here }, (_, result) => { if (result.chartSchemaChange) { // Handle the chart schema change if needed } } ); Alternatively, you can set up an event listener in entrypoint.ts or in any other tool views where you want to track chart schema changes. When you set up an event listener like this, schema changes can be triggered by any part of the application, not just your plug-in. The callback provides the source ID of the triggering plug-in, allowing you to check it against your plug-in ID to determine whether the event originated from your plug-in or another source. Here's an example of how to set up a callback to listen for chartschemachange events: api.addEventListener('chartschemachange', (chartSchemaChange) => { if (chartSchemaChange.pluginId === myPluginId) { // Handle changes caused by this plug-in } else { // Handle changes caused by other plug-ins } }); myPluginId is your plug-in's unique identifier from the manifest This callback allows you to differentiate between schema changes made by your plug-in and those made by other plug-ins, enabling appropriate handling of each scenario."

    "keywords": "Creating a plug-in that writes to a chart in the i2 Notebook web client This tutorial takes you through writing a plug-in for the i2 Notebook web client that can write new records to a chart, arrange the elements that contain those records, and update the view to contain those elements. In doing so, the tutorial demonstrates many aspects of the support in the i2 Notebook API for mutations . In particular, it contains examples of running mutations from plug-in code, and of committing and rolling back mutations in appropriate circumstances. You can find a full version of the source code for this tutorial in the samples/mutation-plugin folder. Prerequisities This tutorial requires a running instance of i2 Analyze on which you have permission to use the i2 Notebook web client. To follow the tutorial, you must install at least version 12 of Node.js on your development machine. For downloads and more information about Node.js, visit the project website at https://nodejs.org . The tutorial also requires you to create GUIDs for a number of its elements. The project files use some sample fixed GUIDs ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 , 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002 , and so on), but you should always create real GUIDs for real projects. Note: A suitable GUID generator is available online at https://www.guidgenerator.com . Create a basic plug-in To arrive at the starting point for this tutorial, follow the instructions in the basic plug-in tutorial , up to but not including the section named Add a ribbon command to the plug-in . Make sure that you have a working plug-in before you continue. Add a ribbon command Starting from the essentially empty plug-in, we'll add a new command to the ribbon that will eventually add some Person records to the current chart. In entrypoint.js , just before the call to initializationComplete() , create a command and surface it on the Home tab: const addRecords = api.commands.createCommand({ id: '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002', name: 'Add items', type: 'application', icon: { type: 'inlineSvg', svg: '<svg viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><rect width=\"8\" height=\"8\" x=\"4\" y=\"4\"/></svg>', }, onExecute() {}, }); api.commands.applicationRibbon.homeTab .after(api.commands.applicationRibbon.homeTab.systemGroups.searchInfoStore) .surfaceCommands(addRecords); So far, this command is almost identical to the one that you would have added, if you had continued with the basic plug-in tutorial. Reload i2 Notebook and check that the action is visible in the application ribbon. Add entity records Next, we're going to do something different from the basic tutorial. The command will add records to the chart, so we need to provide the data for those records, and identify the schema types that it conforms to. At the top of the entrypoint.js file, add some dummy data to serve as the source for the records: const personData = [ { firstName: 'Lou', familyName: 'Tuft', }, { firstName: 'Jessy', familyName: 'Roberts', }, { firstName: 'Jayme', familyName: 'Timberson', }, ]; Also define the entity type and property types from the schema that will apply to the entity records. Place this code at the top of the file, next to the dummy data: const personEntityTypeId = 'ET5'; const firstNamePropertyTypeId = 'PER4'; const familyNamePropertyTypeId = 'PER6'; Inside the implementation of onExecute() , add the following code to get the entity and property type objects that you need for the dummy data: const { getItemType } = application.chart.schema; const personEntityType = getItemType(personEntityTypeId); const firstNamePropertyType = personEntityType.getPropertyType(firstNamePropertyTypeId); const familyNamePropertyType = personEntityType.getPropertyType(familyNamePropertyTypeId); At this point, you have the data, and you've identified the entity and property types in the i2 Analyze schema that model that data. Now we can start to do something with it. Immediately after the previous code, add a call to runTrackedMutations() and start the mutation handler that will add records to the chart: api.runTrackedMutations((_application, mutations) => { // Mutations go here }); The changes that we want to make to the chart must take place in the function that we pass to runTrackedMutations() . Start the handler by looping over the contents of the personData object, and using the entity type and property types that we retrieved earlier to add entity records to the chart: for (const person of personData) { mutations.addEntityRecord({ itemType: personEntityType, properties: { [firstNamePropertyType.id]: person.firstName, [familyNamePropertyType.id]: person.familyName, }, }); } Note: Alternatively, you might decide to add an \"empty\" entity record first, and then edit it: for (const person of personData) { const newPerson = mutations.addEntityRecord({ itemType: personEntityType, }); newPerson.setProperties({ [firstNamePropertyType.id]: person.firstName, [familyNamePropertyType.id]: person.familyName, }); } To complete the mutation handler, you must return an object that tells the application whether to commit the mutation. Since this is a tracked mutation, you must also supply the name of the entry to add to the undo stack. Add this code, just after the for loop: return { type: 'commit', actionDisplayName: 'Add records', }; Note: A tracked mutation adds an entry to the undo stack. If the user executes the undo action, all the mutation commands that were added are reversed, putting the chart back into its state before the runTrackedMutations() call. An untracked mutation does not add an entry to the undo stack, but is limited to mutation commands that affect selection and the viewport. Reload i2 Notebook and run the command. The Person records that you created are added to new node elements on the chart. Add linked records Next, we'll put some more entity records on the chart, and create links between the new records and the Person records that you already created. Add another set of data, which we'll use to define some events: const eventEntityTypeId = 'ET2'; const eventTypePropertyTypeId = 'EVE3'; const startDateTimePropertyTypeId = 'EVE4'; const observedLinkTypeId = 'LOB1'; const eventData = [ { type: 'Theft', dateTime: '2022-03-01T12:31', timeZoneId: 'Europe/London', wasSeen: 'Tuft', }, { type: 'Arson', location: 'New York', dateTime: '2021-11-23T10:33', timeZoneId: 'America/New_York', wasSeen: 'Roberts', }, { type: 'Assault', dateTime: '2022-05-07T17:14', timeZoneId: 'America/Los_Angeles', wasSeen: 'Timberson', }, ]; Notice how each event has a wasSeen property that determines which Person record the event should be linked to. Add the following code to get the entity, property, and link type objects for the new data, just after the similar code that you added to onExecute() earlier: const { getItemType } = application.chart.schema; const eventEntityType = getItemType(eventEntityTypeId); const eventTypePropertyType = getItemType.getPropertyType(eventTypePropertyTypeId); const startDateTimePropertyType = eventEntityType.getPropertyType( eventEntityType, startDateTimePropertyTypeId ); const observedLinkType = getItemType(observedLinkTypeId); To populate the events' time zone properties, we'll add another helper function that looks up time zones by their identifiers. Add this code after the other helper functions at the top of the file: /** * @param {import(\"@i2analyze/notebook-sdk\").data.IKeyedReadOnlyCollection<string,import(\"@i2analyze/notebook-sdk\").data.ITimeZone>} timeZones * @param {string} timeZoneId */ function getTimeZone(timeZones, timeZoneId) { const timeZone = timeZones.get(timeZoneId); if (timeZone === undefined) { throw new Error('No time zone matches ${timeZoneId}'); } return timeZone; } Note: The /** @param {import...} */ and /** @type {import...} */ code helps the JavaScript type system to understand what we're working with, which enables auto-completion in the rest of the code. If we used TypeScript to create the entrypoint.js file, we'd use import type statements instead. To make it easier to find the Person to whom a particular Event is related, we'll add a Map object that contains our Person records, keyed by their familyName property values. /** * @type {Map<string,import(\"@i2analyze/notebook-sdk\").app.IPendingRecord>} */ const personLookup = new Map(); Note: We need the map because we can't just look up the records on the chart, even after the call to addEntityRecord() . They're not actually on the chart, because the mutation is yet to be committed. Amend the for loop that queues the Person records for addition to the chart so that it matches this code, which also adds the new records to the Map . for (const person of personData) { const personRecord = mutations.addEntityRecord({ itemType: personEntityType, properties: { [firstNamePropertyType.id]: person.firstName, [familyNamePropertyType.id]: person.familyName, }, }); personLookup.set(person.familyName, personRecord); } Once again, you have the data and the appropriate item and property types. Now we can use the new data to create some more records, starting with events. In the tracked mutation handler, just after the for loop above, insert the following code: for (const event of eventData) { const startDateTime = mutations.valueFactory.createZonedDateTime( event.dateTime, getTimeZone(api.allTimeZones, event.timeZoneId), false ); const eventRecord = mutations.addEntityRecord({ itemType: eventEntityType, properties: { [eventTypePropertyType.id]: event.type, [startDateTimePropertyType.id]: startDateTime, }, }); } The mutations object provides a number of factory methods that you can use to create valid values for record properties. This code uses createZonedDateTime() to set the event's date-and-time property. Next, add the link records that connect the Event entities to the Person entities, using the lookup map to do so. Put this code inside the for loop, just after the call to addEntityRecord() : const personSeenRecord = personLookup.get(event.wasSeen); if (personSeenRecord === undefined) { throw new Error(`Person matching ${event.wasSeen} is missing`); } mutations.addLinkRecord({ itemType: observedLinkType, fromEnd: eventRecord, toEnd: personSeenRecord, linkDirection: 'with', }); Reload i2 Notebook, create a chart so that you're starting from fresh, and run the command. This time, the Person and Event records are added to the chart, and they are connected through Observed link records. Changing chart selection We've added the events to the chart, but we can also add them to the current selection, which is a common operation in real plug-ins. Add this code after the call to addEntityRecord() : mutations.selection.add(eventRecord); Reload i2 Notebook again and run the command. This time, the Event records are selected on the chart. Mutating elements, and mutation rollback We can use mutations to affect the elements on the chart as well as the records that they contain. Let's try arranging the elements that contain Events into a left-to-right time sequence. In entrypoint.js , before the call to initializationComplete() , create another command and surface it in the ribbon: const arrangeEvents = api.commands.createCommand({ id: '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000003', name: 'Arrange events', type: 'unscoped', icon: { type: 'inlineSvg', svg: '<svg viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><rect width=\"8\" height=\"8\" x=\"4\" y=\"4\"/></svg>', }, onExecute(application) { // Execute code goes here }, }); api.commands.applicationRibbon.homeTab.after(addRecords).surfaceCommands(arrangeEvents); Before we arrange the elements, we should first validate that the current selection contains only Event records. If it does not, we'll roll back the mutation and display a description of the problem to the user. Start implementing the new onExecute() method like this: api.runTrackedMutations((application, mutations) => { const selection = application.chart.selection; if ( !selection.entityRecords.every((record) => record.itemType.analyzeId === eventEntityTypeId) ) { return { type: 'rollback', report: { details: 'Selection must contain only Event record types', title: 'Cannot arrange items', type: 'error', }, }; } return { type: 'commit', actionDisplayName: 'Arrange events', }; }); Reload i2 Notebook, start a new chart, and run the two commands in sequence. Running the second command results in a system error. The selected records are all Events, but the mutation handler involves no operations, and committing a mutation that contains no operations is not valid. We'll address that in a moment. Select all the elements on the chart, and run the Arrange Events command again. This time, your error notification appears, because the selection contains more than just Event records. Rolling back a mutation that contains no operations does not result in a system error, and is valid in a scenario like this when you want to display a notification. With the type check in place, we can inspect the date-and-time properties of the selected Event records, sort the records according to the values of those properties, add finally perform the mutation that arranges the elements into that sort order. Add the following code after the selection check. It sorts the selected records and uses setCenter() to move them into their new positions. const { getItemType } = application.chart.schema; const eventEntityType = getItemType(eventEntityTypeId); const startDateTimePropertyType = eventEntityType.getPropertyType(startDateTimePropertyTypeId); /** * @param {import(\"@i2analyze/notebook-sdk\").visual.INode} node */ function getEventDate(node) { const eventRecord = node.records.firstOrDefault(undefined); if (eventRecord === undefined) { throw new Error('Unexpected missing record'); } const eventDateTime = eventRecord.getProperty(startDateTimePropertyType); if (eventDateTime !== undefined && !eventRecord.isValueUnfetched(eventDateTime)) { return /** @type {import(\"@i2analyze/notebook-sdk\").data.IZonedDateTime} */ (eventDateTime); } } /** * @param {import(\"@i2analyze/notebook-sdk\").visual.INode} nodeA * @param {import(\"@i2analyze/notebook-sdk\").visual.INode} nodeB */ function compareEvents(nodeA, nodeB) { const eventADate = getEventDate(nodeA); const eventBDate = getEventDate(nodeB); if (eventADate !== undefined && eventBDate !== undefined) { const dateA = eventADate.dateTime.toJSDate().getTime(); const dateB = eventBDate.dateTime.toJSDate().getTime(); return dateA - dateB; } else { return 0; } } const firstEvent = selection.affectedNodes.firstOrDefault(undefined); if (!firstEvent) { return { type: 'rollback', report: { title: 'Nothing selected', details: 'Nothing was selected, so no events were arranged.', type: 'information', }, }; } const sortedEvents = Array.from(selection.affectedNodes).sort(compareEvents); const targetLocation = firstEvent.center; let targetX = targetLocation.x; for (const event of sortedEvents) { mutations.editNode(event).setCenter(event, { x: targetX, y: targetLocation.y }); targetX += 200; } Finally, mutate the view so that the newly rearranged elements fit inside it. Add this code just before we return from the mutation handler: mutations.view.fitToSelection(); Reload i2 Notebook, start another new chart, and run the commands in sequence. The selected elements are rearranged into a left-to-right temporal layout. Next steps By following the procedure in this tutorial, you've created an i2 Notebook plug-in that demonstrates some of the fundamental techniques for changing the information on an i2 Notebook chart. You've seen how to construct tracked and untracked mutations, how to commit them or roll them back, and how to use them for operations including creating and editing records and moving elements on the chart surface. Many real plug-ins that you write for the i2 Notebook web client will use mutations as the means to achieving their purpose. But no matter how complicated the behavior of your plug-in becomes, the basic principles of interacting with the API do not change."

    "title": "Creating a React plug-in",
    "keywords": "Creating a React plug-in This is a long tutorial that will take a couple of hours to work through. It's designed to function more like a complete hands-on workshop than a simple 'Hello World' example, and takes you from nothing to creating a working (but simplified) replacement for the Record Inspector, using React. The tutorial covers the following concepts: Configuring React correctly Starting a plug-in project Running the i2 Notebook plug-in development proxy Creating and surfacing commands in the application ribbon and the pop-up menu Subscribing to change and selection events, and using them to control the state of commands Creating a tool view Accessing chart data Accessing user data, such as theme choice and locale Formatting, localization, and right-to-left language support Common mistakes when writing plug-ins, with solutions for fixing them And it does so as you build the example through these stages: Create the simplest possible plug-in, without a custom user interface. We'll get it working in a development environment, and then add a ribbon command that accesses chart data and sends some of it to an external website for viewing. Create a custom tool view, and learn about configuring React paths and working with a Content Security Policy. Do some basic styling and theming. Access property data, learn about the facilities that the API provides to assist with consistent formatting, and display images and links to 360 views. (Briefly) cover issues with right-to-left and bidirectional text. Add record-navigation support to the tool view, and learn about restrictions on when you can access i2 Notebook data and best practices for working within those constraints. Learn about persisting tool view state, so that the user interface doesn't reset itself when being docked or floated. Remove the built-in Record Inspector and replace it with our own. Deploy our completed plug-in onto an i2 Analyze server. You can find a full version of the source code for this tutorial in the samples/react-plugin folder. Prerequisites This tutorial requires a running instance of i2 Analyze on which you have permission to use the i2 Notebook web client. To follow the tutorial, you must install at least version 12 of Node.js on your development machine. For downloads and more information about Node.js, visit the project website at https://nodejs.org . The tutorial also requires you to create GUIDs for a number of its elements. The project files use some sample fixed GUIDs ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 , 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002 , and so on), but you should always create real GUIDs for real projects. Note: A suitable GUID generator is available online at https://www.guidgenerator.com . Create a basic UI-free plug-in A basic i2 Notebook plug-in has the same requirements as a more complex one: in the plug-in directory, you must create the manifest and the entry point that enable the i2 Notebook web client to load and integrate your plug-in. The first part of this tutorial covers those requirements, and also explains how to set up both your development environment and a local Node.js server. Create an empty React TypeScript application. For example: npm create vite@latest plugin-react -- --template react-ts Note: The Vite build tool comprises a development server and a build command for creating and testing modern web applications. For more information, see https://vitejs.dev . You don't have to use TypeScript to develop a plug-in for i2 Notebook, but the extra type information makes lots of things more robust, and so we do use it in this tutorial. Change directory to the new plug-in and install the dependencies. For example: cd plugin-react And then: npm install It will likely take several minutes to configure and install the dependencies. Add the i2 Notebook SDK package: npm install @i2analyze/notebook-sdk The package contains a type library that enables inline assistance in your IDE. Now you're in position to write the plug-in itself, starting with the manifest. Using an IDE such as VSCode, create a file named plugin.json in public , with the following contents: { \"$schema\": \"https://i2group.github.io/notebook-sdk/schemas/plugin-manifest.json\" } The schema enforces the structure and content of the file. For more information, see the plug-in manifest documentation. Continue to populate the manifest with values for \"name\" , \"pluginId\" , and \"pluginVersion\" ; and set \"entryPointUrl\" to \"./entrypoint.js\" . For example: \"name\": \"My i2 Notebook plug-in\", \"pluginId\": \"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001\", \"pluginVersion\": \"1.0.0\", \"entryPointUrl\": \"./entrypoint.js\" Next, we can create the entry point. Add a file named entrypoint.js to the public directory, and populate it: // @ts-check /* global notebook */ /// <reference types=\"@i2analyze/notebook-sdk\" /> async function main() { const api = await notebook.getEntryPointApi('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001', '1.1'); api.logger.info('plug-in running'); api.initializationComplete(); } void main(); Through this code, the plug-in retrieves the version of the entry point API that it wants to use, and uses it to declare that it has finished initializing. The GUID here must match the one in the plug-in manifest. If you enter the code by hand, you'll see how the type library provides auto-completion as you go. Modify tsconfig.json to configure the environment to use \"downlevelIteration\" . In \"compilerOptions\" , add \"downlevelIteration\": true . Back on the command line, start the React project in development mode: npm run dev Make a note of the connection address. For example, http://localhost:5173 . We'll need that to connect to, and reference, our plug-in. Navigate to the project in a web browser. You should see a React demonstration page. Confirm that plugin.json and entrypoint.js are served correctly from their respective paths (for example, http://localhost:5173/plugin.json and http://localhost:5173/entrypoint.js ). Test the plug-in in the i2 Notebook web client While we're developing and testing a plug-in, we won't deploy the plug-in directly to the i2 Analyze server. Instead, we'll use the i2 Notebook SDK plug-in development proxy to add our plug-in to an existing i2 Notebook deployment without needing to modify it. Anywhere on your workstation, create and populate a file named devproxy.json : { \"$schema\": \"https://i2group.github.io/notebook-sdk/schemas/devproxy.json\" } This forms the basis of the configuration file for the development proxy. Add a value for \"server\" that is the URL of an existing i2 Analyze deployment. For example, \"http://localhost:9082/opal/\" . Add a value for \"port\" to specify the port that the development proxy should listen on. For example, 4000 . Add a value for \"plugins\" that contains the root URL of your plug-in. For example, [\"http://localhost:5173/\"] for the server that we configured above. On the command line, navigate to the folder that contains the configuration file, and start the i2 Notebook plug-in development proxy (no installation is required): npx @i2analyze/notebook-sdk-plugin-proxy --config devproxy.json Open the proxy URL in a browser, log in to the i2 Notebook web client and open a new chart. For example, http://localhost:4000/opal/ . Open the browser's developer console and check for our plug-in's message being logged: If you see this message, then the plug-in is working correctly. Add a ribbon command to the plug-in So far, you have a plug-in that's being loaded into the i2 Notebook web client - but it doesn't do anything. Next, we'll make the plug-in add a command that opens geospatial locations in Google Maps to the application ribbon. In entrypoint.js , just before the call to initializationComplete() , create a command: const viewOnMap = api.commands.createCommand({ id: '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002', name: 'View on map', icon: { type: 'inlineSvg', svg: '<svg viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><rect width=\"8\" height=\"8\" x=\"4\" y=\"4\"/></svg>', }, type: 'records', onExecute(payload) {}, }); Straight afterward, surface the command on the ribbon's Home tab, just after the Information Store group: api.commands.applicationRibbon.homeTab .after(api.commands.applicationRibbon.homeTab.systemGroups.searchInfoStore) .surfaceCommands(viewOnMap); Reload the i2 Notebook web client, and check that the action is visible in the application ribbon. Clicking the button won't do anything yet because we haven't implemented onExecute() , so let's do that now. Create this helper function at the top level of the entrypoint.js file: /** * @param {import(\"@i2analyze/notebook-sdk\").data.IReadOnlyCollection<import(\"@i2analyze/notebook-sdk\").records.IChartRecord>} records */ function findGeospatialValue(records) { for (const record of records) { for (const propertyType of record.itemType.propertyTypes) { if (propertyType.logicalType === 'geospatial') { const property = record.getProperty(propertyType); if (property !== undefined && !record.isValueUnfetched(property)) { return /** @type {import(\"@i2analyze/notebook-sdk\").data.IGeoPoint} */ (property); } } } } return undefined; } This function performs a simple scan of the records it receives, looking for a non-empty geospatial property that it returns if it finds one. Note: The /** @type {import...} */ and /** @param {import...} */ code helps the JavaScript type system to understand what we're working with, which enables auto-completion in the rest of the code. If we used TypeScript to create our entrypoint.js file, we'd use import type statements instead. We can now use the helper function in the implementation of onExecute() that we left empty in the call to CreateCommand() . We'll take the latitude and longitude to a new Google Maps window: onExecute(payload) { const property = findGeospatialValue(payload.records); if (!property) { return; } window.open( `https://www.google.com/maps/@${property.latitude},${property.longitude},18z`, \"_blank\" ); }, Reload the web client again, select an element with a geospatial property, and try the command. Google Maps should open at the relevant location. Make the command sensitive to selection There's a problem with our command: the button is enabled even if the selection doesn't actually contain a geospatial property. That would be misleading for a user, but we can fix it by taking control of the surfacing of the command in the user interface. After the onExecute() parameter to createCommand() , add an onSurface() function definition: onSurface(action, eventApi, signal) { eventApi.addEventListener( \"recordscontextchange\", (context) => { action.setEnabled(!!findGeospatialValue(context.records)); }, { dispatchNow: true, signal } ); }, There are a few things to notice here: i2 Notebook calls our onSurface() function with an action object that represents the user interface control to which the command is bound each time it is surfaced. A single command might be surfaced in several places, and you can use the action object to react differently in each of them. The function also receives an eventApi object through which it can listen to changes in the records to which the action is being applied; and a signal object that indicates when this particular surfacing of the command is being removed. In our implementation, we subscribe to the recordscontextchange event, which tells us when the current records change. When they do change, we set the enabled state of the action to a value based on whether there is a geospatial value in the current records. Event listeners are normally invoked when the event occurs. However, we don't want to wait for a recordscontextchange event before we run our setEnabled() code, so we specify dispatchNow: true to invoke the callback immediately, without waiting for the event. This in turn causes our action to be enabled or disabled correctly, right away. We forward the signal to the event listener so that it unsubscribes automatically from the recordscontextchange event when the action is unsurfaced. Reload the i2 Notebook web client. The button in the application ribbon is now enabled only when a geospatial property exists in the selection. Use the command in more than one place As well as adding it to the ribbon, we can add exactly the same command to the chart pop-up menu with a single line of code. After the existing call to surfaceCommands() , add: api.commands.chartItemPopupMenu.surfaceCommands(viewOnMap); Reload the web client. The same command, with the same enablement rules, is now present in the chart's pop-up menu. Create a tool view The first part of this tutorial didn't use any features from the React framework! That changes now, as we use React to create a custom user interface for our plug-in: Navigate to the src folder inside the project directory, and create a React component in a new file named ToolView.tsx : export default function ToolView() { return <div>tool-view1 works!</div>; } In the same folder, replace the contents of the generated App.tsx file with: import ToolView from './ToolView'; export default function App() { return ( <div> <ToolView /> </div> ); } In a web browser, load the root page ( / ) from your React development environment ( http://localhost:5173/ ). You should see the message: \"tool-view1 works!\". We'll now turn the React component into an i2 Notebook tool view. In public/entrypoint.js , insert a line before the call to initializationComplete() : const toolView = api.createToolView({ name: 'My tool view', path: './', }); This line declares a tool view by specifying its display name ('My tool view') and its location relative to the entry point , which is ' ./ '. Still in the entry point code, tell i2 Notebook to create a command that opens and closes the tool view: const toggle = api.commands.createToolViewToggleCommand( { id: '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000003', name: 'My tool', icon: { type: 'inlineSvg', svg: '<svg viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><circle cx=\"8\" cy=\"8\" r=\"4\" /></svg>', }, }, toolView ); createToolViewToggleCommand() is a helper function that removes the need to write repetitive code to create a button that will hide or show a tool view. If you want to add additional functionality to the command (for example, disable the button under certain conditions), then you will need to create a normal command (using createCommand() ). Finally, surface the command in the application ribbon's Home tab. This code places it after the View on map command that we developed above: api.commands.applicationRibbon.homeTab.after(viewOnMap.id).surfaceCommands(toggle); Reload the i2 Notebook web client, and you'll see the new button in the ribbon. Click it to display the tool view in the user interface; click it a second time to hide it again. However, while the tool view pane is correctly opening and closing, there's a problem: we don't see the contents of our tool view in the pane. To see what's happening, open up the developer tools in your browser, and look at the network diagnostics. When you click to display the tool view, you'll see that requests to load resources are failing due to Content Security Policy restrictions. We'll fix those problems in the next section. Configure React to serve content from the correct place New React applications are hard-wired to serve their content from the root ( / ) of the server they're running on. i2 Notebook plug-ins, on the other hand, are served from <context root>/plugins/<some directory> on the i2 Analyze server, and our plug-in development proxy is simulating that for us. When you display the React tool view, the .html file loads correctly, but the .tsx file fail to load because the .html file refers to them relative to the root - for example, /src/main.tsx . This would work if the plug-in were served from / , but as it won't be, we need to make React generate the paths differently. We'll adjust the Vite configuration to serve the content from an explicit, hard-coded path. Find the context path that your Liberty server is using. This is the path part of the server URL in your development proxy configuration file. For example, if your server is http://someserver:1234/contextpath , then it's /contextpath that we need. Pick a short plug-in folder name, such as myplugin . The name needs to be different from every other plug-in in your deployment, but remember that you won't have to use it at deployment time; only during development. The path to your plug-in will be /<contextpath>/plugins/<shortname> . For example, /opal/plugins/myplugin . Modify the path to your plug-in in the development proxy configuration file, adding the plug-in path. For example, replace http://localhost:5173/ with http://localhost:5173/opal/plugins/myplugin . Open the vite.config.ts file in the project root, and add base: '/opal/plugins/myplugin' to the defineConfig object: export default defineConfig({ plugins: [react()], base: '/opal/plugins/myplugin', }); Stop the development proxy, and then start it again with the same command as before. Reload the i2 Notebook web client and try the tool view again. There's still no message. Look in the browser console, and you'll see some errors about the browser refusing to load the script within the .html file because of a violation of a content security policy (CSP) directive. We must fix that before we'll be able to apply any styling successfully. Configure the content security policy i2 Notebook runs with a heavily locked-down content security policy (CSP) to limit the attack surface. Vite, however, loads the main.tsx file through a <script> element. It also uses inline styling. Both of these features require a looser CSP. We can use the plug-in manifest to loosen the CSP for our tool view. Edit the public/plugin.json file and add a \"toolViewCsp\" section: \"toolViewCsp\": { \"script-src\": \"'unsafe-inline'\", \"style-src\": \"'unsafe-inline'\" } Once again, reload the i2 Notebook web client and display the tool view. The 'tool-view1 works!' text should now be displayed in the tool view panel. The browser console will now be free of CSP errors associated with styling and scripting for our plug-in, so we can proceed with some styling. Note: If you open the developer tools at this point and look at the console, you will still see other CSP errors where Vite is trying to connect to ws://... . These violations are due to the Vite application developer environment, and you can safely ignore them. Create a hook that provides the tool view API We'll need to access the i2 Notebook tool view API from multiple components in our React application. Also, because fetching the API is asynchronous, we'll want to prevent the React application from loading until it is ready and available to use. To address both of these requirements, we can make the tool view API available through a React hook. In the src folder, create a React context and helper hook in a new file named useToolViewApi.ts : import type { toolview } from '@i2analyze/notebook-sdk'; import { createContext, useContext } from 'react'; export const ToolViewApiContext = createContext<toolview.IToolViewApi | undefined>(undefined); export function useToolViewApi() { return useContext(ToolViewApiContext)!; } In the same folder, replace the contents of App.tsx with the following: import { getToolViewApi } from '@i2analyze/notebook-sdk'; import type { toolview } from '@i2analyze/notebook-sdk'; import { useEffect, useState } from 'react'; import ToolView from './ToolView'; import { ToolViewApiContext } from './useToolViewApi'; export default function App() { const [toolViewApi, setToolViewApi] = useState<toolview.IToolViewApi | undefined>(); useEffect(() => { getToolViewApi().then((api) => { setToolViewApi(api); }); }, []); if (toolViewApi) { return ( <ToolViewApiContext.Provider value={toolViewApi}> <ToolView /> </ToolViewApiContext.Provider> ); } else { return null; } } Let's walk through that code: The App component imports the getToolViewApi() function from the @i2analyze/notebook-sdk package. It calls that function inside a useEffect() , so that getToolViewApi() is called when the App component renders for the first time. After getToolViewApi() returns its value asynchronously, that value is put into the toolViewApi state variable. Until toolViewApi has a value, App renders nothing (via null ). When toolViewApi is available (in practice this will be almost immediately), it renders <ToolView /> inside a custom React context, which makes the API value available to every component in the sub-tree. Configure the tool view for i2 Notebook web client themes The i2 Notebook web client supports a number of visual themes. If you're using a light theme, the \"tool-view1 works!\" text should have been clear in your tool view. But if you're using a dark theme, the text was probably harder to read. We haven't yet configured the tool view to respect and respond to themes. Note: To change the theme in the i2 Notebook web client, go to the user menu and select Settings to open the Settings dialog. To style our tool view correctly, we need to access the theme information and use it to change the appearance of the text. First, in src/main.tsx , remove the import './index.css' . Create a file named src/ToolView.css that contains: .dark-theme { color: white; } .light-theme { color: black; } In other words, we want to set the font color to white in dark themes, and to black in light themes. In src/ToolView.tsx , import useToolViewApi and use it to apply a different CSS class from ToolView.css , based on the current theme: import { useToolViewApi } from './useToolViewApi'; import './ToolView.css'; export default function ToolView() { const toolViewApi = useToolViewApi(); const themeClass = toolViewApi.theme.appearance === 'dark' ? 'dark-theme' : 'light-theme'; return <div className={themeClass}>tool-view1 works!</div>; } Now, our tool view will apply the light-theme or dark-theme class based on theme information from the i2 Notebook web client. Reload the i2 Notebook web client and display the tool view again. Change the theme by swapping between light and dark, and notice how the tool view automatically adjusts its text coloring to match. Access record data We've done a lot of work to make our tool view integrate nicely with the i2 Notebook web client. Now it needs to do something useful. Let's enable it to access the data in selected records, which starts by working out what the current selection is : At the top of the ToolView.tsx file, import the chart namespace from @i2analyze/notebook-sdk and several helpers from React: import { useCallback, useEffect, useState } from 'react'; import type { chart, records } from '@i2analyze/notebook-sdk'; Inside the ToolView() component function, after themeClass calculation, set up an initially empty piece of recordLabel state with: const [recordLabel, setRecordLabel] = useState(''); When the chart selection changes, we'll set our label state to be the label of the first record in the selection. Continue in the same file, defining a selection change handler and a helper function: const setValuesForRecord = useCallback((record: records.IChartRecord | undefined) => { if (record) { setRecordLabel(record.labelOrFallback); } else { setRecordLabel('No records selected.'); } }, []); const handleChartSelectionChange = useCallback<chart.SelectionListener>( (selection) => { const record = selection.records.firstOrDefault(undefined); setValuesForRecord(record); }, [setValuesForRecord] ); The firstOrDefault function returns the first record from the selection, falling back to the specified undefined if there isn't a first record. The labelOrFallback property reads the label of the record, falling back to a standard string if empty. We can use the handler to subscribe to the chartselectionchange event. We must also clean up the event subscription when the ToolView component is unmounted. Just before the return statement, add: useEffect(() => { const unsubscribe = toolViewApi.addEventListener( 'chartselectionchange', handleChartSelectionChange ); return unsubscribe; }, [handleChartSelectionChange, toolViewApi]); Note: This code isn't quite right, but we'll explain why (and come back and fix it) shortly. Now we'll display the extracted record label. Replace the existing return statement with: return ( <div className={themeClass}> <h1 className=\"record-header\">{recordLabel}</h1> </div> ); Note: This and later HTML code uses CSS classes to apply styling to the tool view. To add the classes to your project, replace the existing file at src/ToolView.css with its equivalent from Github . Try the tool view again. Click around on the chart, selecting different items. It does now display the label of the first record in the chart selection, but there's still a problem. Close the tool view, select an item on the chart, and then open the tool view again. Notice that when the tool view opens , it's not displaying the record label. After you change the selection, the tool view does display the label correctly, but it's not displaying correctly at startup. The problem is that we're only setting the recordLabel field after a chartselectionchange event is received. Adding the dispatchNow option to the addEventListener subscription arranges for the chartselectionchange handler to be called immediately. In src/ToolView.tsx , inside the useEffect() addEventListener() call, add a dispatchNow: true option: const unsubscribe = toolViewApi.addEventListener( 'chartselectionchange', handleChartSelectionChange, { dispatchNow: true } ); return unsubscribe; Reload the web client again, select an item, and open the tool view. This time, it immediately displays the label of the first selected record (or our \"No records selected.\" message) without waiting for a selection change. Display property data We have the record label, but we can build up our tool view to display data from more record properties. In ToolView.tsx , modify the existing import to add the data and schema namespaces: import { chart, data, records, schema } from '@i2analyze/notebook-sdk'; Declare an interface that represents how we'll display the properties that we're going to retrieve: interface IProperty { id: schema.ChartPropertyTypeId; label: string; value: data.PropertyValue; } Next, after the recordLabel useState() call, add a state value to store the record property information: const [properties, setProperties] = useState<IProperty[]>([]); And edit setValuesForRecord() to extract property as well as label information from the record: const setValuesForRecord = useCallback((record: records.IChartRecord | undefined) => { if (record) { setRecordLabel(record.labelOrFallback); const properties: IProperty[] = []; for (const propertyType of record.itemType.propertyTypes) { const property = record.getProperty(propertyType); if (property !== undefined && !record.isValueUnfetched(property)) { properties.push({ id: propertyType.id, label: propertyType.displayName, value: property, }); } } setProperties(properties); } else { setRecordLabel('No records selected.'); setProperties([]); } }, []); The record.getProperty() method can return values of type undefined , data.IValueNotFetched , or data.PropertyValue : An undefined value indicates that the record has no value for the specified property type. A not-fetched property value ( data.IValueNotFetched ) indicates that the record does have a value for the property, but we don't have that value in the client at the moment. Note: You can ensure the property is fetched by using the chart.ensurePropertiesFetched() method. A property value ( data.PropertyValue ) can be an object representing any of the legal data types in the schema. It might be a string, or a number, or a more complicated object such as a date, time, date-time, decimal, or geospatial structure. When we have a record, we filter out the undefined and not-fetched properties before displaying the remainder in our tool view. When we have no record at all, we set the properties to be an empty array. Modify the rendering code (the return statement) to display the property data after the record label: return ( <div className={themeClass}> <h1 className=\"record-header\">{recordLabel}</h1> <div className=\"record-properties\"> {properties.map((property) => ( <div key={property.id} className=\"property\"> <div className=\"property-label\">{property.label}</div> <div className=\"property-value\">{property.value}</div> </div> ))} </div> </div> ); Reload the i2 Notebook web client and try out the tool view. Depending on what data you have in your chart, it might or might not work! If you have only string data, it'll work just fine. However, if you have date, time, date-time, or geospatial objects in your selected records, you'll get errors from React along the lines of: Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {dateTime timeZone, isDst}) . We've attempted to render property values without considering what they are or how to format them. Take a closer look at the typing for data.PropertyValue . It can represent any of the legal data types in the schema! These values might be objects, and in displaying them we should respect the user's locale and formatting settings. Extract the formatter so that it's easy for us to use it in multiple places. In ToolView.tsx , just after the useState() calls, add: const formatter = toolViewApi.formatter; And add a call to formatter.formatValue() in the property value rendering code: <div className=\"property-value\">{formatter.formatValue(property.value)}</div> Reload the i2 Notebook web client and try out the tool view. Property values are now displayed, and numbers, dates, and times are formatted the same as in the rest of the application. Display an image, and a link to more information So far, our tool view displays the label of a selected record and its property values. In this section, we'll go further by displaying an image to represent the record, and by linking to its 360 view (if it has one). First, add state variables in the ToolView component to store the image and the URL, just after the existing useState() calls: const [threeSixtyUrl, setThreeSixtyUrl] = useState<string | undefined>(); const [image, setImage] = useState<data.IImage | undefined>(); In the setValuesForRecord() function, set these properties if we have a record, and clear them if we don't: if (record) { setRecordLabel(record.labelOrFallback); setThreeSixtyUrl(record.get360ViewUrl()); setImage(record.image ?? (record.isEntity() ? record.itemType.image : undefined)); ... } else { setRecordLabel(\"No records selected.\"); setThreeSixtyUrl(undefined); setImage(undefined); ... } This code uses the record image if one exists, and falls back to the image associated with the record's item type if it does not. Still in ToolView.tsx , edit the <h1> rendering code to display the image and the link (if it exists): <h1 className=\"record-header\"> {image ? <img className=\"record-image\" src={image.href} alt={image.description} /> : null} {threeSixtyUrl ? ( <a className=\"record-label\" href={threeSixtyUrl} target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"> {recordLabel} </a> ) : ( <span className=\"record-label\">{recordLabel}</span> )} </h1> The target=\"_blank\" attribute on the <a> element is so that the view opens in a new browser tab or window, rather than in the tool view! React's linting tool recommends rel=\"noreferrer\" . Reload the i2 Notebook web client once again, and watch the behavior of the tool view: For entity records that came from the Information Store, the label is now also a hyperlink. For all records that have images, the tool view displays that image. Support globalization Not all users speak English, and not all languages are read from left to right. If your tool view is aimed internationally, it should flow and display its contents correctly in all locales. The i2 Notebook Web API includes support for dealing with localization. First, let's demonstrate one of the problems by simulating an Arabic locale. In your browser address bar, after the contextpath part of the address, add the query parameter ?translationLocale=ar-sa and reload the page. (For example, http://localhost:4000/opal/?translationLocale=ar-sa#charts ) The i2 Notebook web client responds by simulating the locale of Arabic (Saudi Arabia). Note: The web client actually provides two locales: the translationLocale , which is used for the translation of the text; and the formattingLocale , which is used for formatting data for display. The ?translationLocale query parameter simulates both the translation and the formatting locale. If you display the built-in Record Inspector tool (using the R keyboard shortcut), you'll see how its user interface now flows from right to left. When you open your tool view, however, it still flows from left to right. The API can provide the information that we need. We just have to use it in the right place! In ToolView.tsx , change the top-level <div> element in the return statement to add a dir attribute: <div dir={toolViewApi.locale.flowDirection} className={themeClass}> The flowDirection property has either the value ltr or rtl , which is perfect for use with the dir HTML attribute. Reload the i2 Notebook web client and display the tool view again. It's laid out correctly according to the locale. When you add and remove the ?translationLocale=ar-sa query parameter, the flow alternates between left-to-right and right-to-left behavior. Note: By using the built-in formatter for property values, we get date, time, and numeric formatting for the Arabic (Saudi Arabia) locale automatically. Select items on your chart that have date, time, or numeric properties to see this in action. Another globalization issue is the text in the tool view. When simulating the Arabic (Saudi Arabia) locale, the \"No records selected.\" text doesn't display correctly - it actually displays as \".No records selected\". This problem occurs because the browser is trying to lay out the text from right to left, but it doesn't realize that the \".\" is meant to flow with the text, and shouldn't be considered by itself. (This issue affects most punctuation characters and numbers that aren't considered to be \"left-to-right\" or \"right-to-left\", but instead take their directionality from the context around them.) To get the text to behave correctly, we need to mark it up with bidirectional characters. Once again, we can use the formatter from the tool view API. In ToolView.tsx , use formatter.wrapForBidi() on both renderings of recordLabel . Replace both instances of: <!-- N.B. Don't mark these examples with ```typescript or ```javascript: the prettier formatter will do unwanted things --> { recordLabel; } with: { formatter.wrapForBidi(recordLabel, 'raw'); } Reload the i2 Notebook web client, and continue to simulate the Arabic (Saudi Arabia) locale. The text is now wrapped correctly, and displays with the period at the end of the text as \"No records selected.\" In general, you should use wrapForBidi() for all read-only text that you display to the user. It's particularly important for text whose contents you don't know in advance because it comes from record data. Update the plug-in code to use wrapForBidi() throughout ToolView.tsx . Specifically, the rendering for property-label and property-value becomes: <div className=\"property-label\"> {formatter.wrapForBidi(property.label, \"raw\")} </div> <div className=\"property-value\"> {formatter.wrapForBidi(formatter.formatValue(property.value), \"raw\")} </div> A further consideration for good globalization is that some images and icons should be reversed in right-to-left locales, while others should not. For example, back and forward navigation buttons should always be mirrored. For more information on this and other topics, consult a resource such as https://material.io/design/usability/bidirectionality.html#mirroring-elements . Before you continue with this tutorial, remove the ?translationLocale=ar-sa query parameter to stop simulating the Arabic (Saudi Arabia) locale. Add record navigation to the tool view So far, we have looked only at the first record in the selection, which is useful in an example but not realistic. Now let's look at all the records in the selection, and provide the user with a pair of buttons to page through those records and inspect their properties. As part of this work, we'll demonstrate what errors can occur if you access the data incorrectly, and then show you how to access the data correctly. Add properties for the index of the current record, the total number of records, and the current selection to ToolView , just after the existing useState() calls: const [currentRecordIndex, setCurrentRecordIndex] = useState(0); const [totalRecords, setTotalRecords] = useState(0); const [selection, setSelection] = useState<chart.ISelection | undefined>(); We'll store the selection and choose a record based on currentRecordIndex . Replace the implementation of handleChartSelectionChange() with the following code: const handleChartSelectionChange = useCallback<chart.SelectionListener>((selection) => { setCurrentRecordIndex(0); setTotalRecords(selection.records.size); setSelection(selection); }, []); useEffect(() => { const records = Array.from(selection?.records || []); setValuesForRecord(records[currentRecordIndex]); }, [selection, setValuesForRecord, currentRecordIndex]); Note: This code isn't quite right, but we'll explain why (and come back and fix it) shortly. Also, ignore any lint warnings you see about the last line for now. They're actually the least of our worries! This stores the selection each time it changes, and uses a useEffect() to update the values for the component each time the current record index changes. Next, we're going to move the responsibility for reporting a lack of records from the record display to a title area. In the setValuesForRecord() function, replace this code: setRecordLabel('No records selected.'); with: setRecordLabel(''); Add handler functions to update the currentRecordIndex , just above handleChartSelectionChange() : const handlePreviousButtonClick = () => { setCurrentRecordIndex((r) => r - 1); }; const handleNextButtonClick = () => { setCurrentRecordIndex((r) => r + 1); }; And just before the return statement, compute a navigationTitle value: const navigationTitle = formatter.wrapForBidi( totalRecords > 0 ? `Record ${formatter.formatValue(currentRecordIndex + 1)} of ${formatter.formatValue( totalRecords )}` : 'No records selected.', 'raw' ); This code creates a title with formatted numbers for the selected record and the total record count. Inside the return statement, just above the <h1> element, add the title and our navigation buttons: <div className=\"record-navigation\"> <div>{navigationTitle}</div> {totalRecords > 0 ? ( <div className=\"navigation-buttons\"> <button className=\"navigation-button\" onClick={handlePreviousButtonClick} title=\"Previous record\" disabled={currentRecordIndex === 0} > &lt; </button> <button className=\"navigation-button\" onClick={handleNextButtonClick} title=\"Next record\" disabled={currentRecordIndex === totalRecords - 1} > &gt; </button> </div> ) : null} </div> This gives users a pair of buttons for changing the current record, and a title displaying which record they're viewing out of the total. It hides the buttons if there are no records selected. Reload the i2 Notebook web client and open the plug-in. It doesn't work. If you look in the console, you'll see an error message: Application and chart data MUST only be accessed during event listener or transaction listener callbacks. It is not safe to access data at any other time. We are trying to access data outside an event or transaction listener. We store the selection data in our component, and attempt to read it when the user clicks Next . It doesn't matter if you're storing the selection or the records. You cannot access i2 Notebook chart data outside an event, mutation, or transaction listener. This rule ensures that API consumers always see a consistent view of the application data. Whenever you want to read data outside an event handler, you must request access to it from the application through a transaction or a mutation. Remove the selection useState() line from ToolView.tsx . Instead of storing the records, we'll use the current record index to request the record that we want from the application. Replace the handleChartSelectionChange() function and the useEffect() after it (which read the selection state variable) with this code: const handleChartSelectionChange = useCallback<chart.SelectionListener>( (selection) => { setCurrentRecordIndex(0); setTotalRecords(selection.records.size); setValuesForRecord(selection.records.firstOrDefault(undefined)); }, [setValuesForRecord] ); useEffect(() => { toolViewApi.runTransaction((application) => { const selection = application.chart.selection; const records = Array.from(selection.records); setTotalRecords(selection.records.size); const record = records[currentRecordIndex]; setValuesForRecord(record); }); }, [toolViewApi, setValuesForRecord, currentRecordIndex]); Working through this new code in detail: The i2 Notebook web client calls the handleChartSelectionChange() function when the chart selection changes. As such, the function is permitted to access as much application data as it likes. As before, it resets the currently selected record index to 0, stores the total number of selected records, and then invokes setValuesForRecord() to set the component state for the record. The useEffect() listens for changes in the currentRecordIndex , and in response to these changes schedules an i2 Notebook application transaction. The callback that runs under that transaction accesses the chart selection and retrieves the currently indexed record, calling setValuesForRecord() . This provides safe access for all of our data. Reload the i2 Notebook web client, select multiple items on the chart, and try using the buttons in our tool view to navigate among their records. Now, it works! Extension: Ensure fetched properties While viewing record properties, eventually a property will be shown as Exists but not fetched . You can ensure that the property is fetched. Change the useEffect() function so that it ensures all properties are fetched before setting the values for records: useEffect(() => { toolViewApi.runTransaction(async (application) => { const selection = application.chart.selection; const records = Array.from(selection.records); setTotalRecords(selection.records.size); const record = records[currentRecordIndex]; if (record) { const propertyTypes = record.itemType.propertyTypes; await application.chart.ensurePropertiesFetched(record, propertyTypes); } setValuesForRecord(record); }); }, [toolViewApi, setValuesForRecord, currentRecordIndex]); Store and restore state when the tool view is floated and docked Our tool view is almost complete, but for now there are still problems to solve. For example, you can select multiple items on the chart surface, and navigate to the second record in the selection by clicking Next . But if you then float the tool view, it returns to showing the first record again. When a tool view is docked or floated, its user interface is completely recreated in a different browser window, causing all of its temporary state to be lost. To address this, we can make use of the volatile store that's available from the tool view API. This store allows us to store state so that it survives tool view re-creation. (It's called the \"volatile\" store because its state does not persist across application reloads.) In ToolView.tsx , add toolview to the @i2analyze/notebook-sdk import: import { chart, data, records, schema, toolview } from '@i2analyze/notebook-sdk'; In ToolView.tsx , just before the computation of navigationTitle , add this code to save the current record index when the tool view is unloading: const handleUnload = useCallback<toolview.ToolViewUnloadListener>(() => { toolViewApi.volatileStore.set('currentRecordIndex', currentRecordIndex); }, [toolViewApi, currentRecordIndex]); useEffect(() => { return toolViewApi.addEventListener('unload', handleUnload); }, [toolViewApi, handleUnload]); This code means that we store currentRecordIndex when the tool view is unloaded. Modify the existing useEffect() function that subscribes to chartselectionchange to retrieve the value of currentRecordIndex from the volatile store when the tool view is loaded. Add the following code before the return unsubscribe line: const initialIndex = toolViewApi.volatileStore.get<number>('currentRecordIndex') || 0; setCurrentRecordIndex(initialIndex); Because we're now fetching data immediately when the tool view starts up, we no longer need to use the dispatchNow option for the chartselectionchange event handler in the above useEffect() . Remove it, leaving the event subscription as follows: const unsubscribe = toolViewApi.addEventListener( 'chartselectionchange', handleChartSelectionChange ); The tool view now correctly maintains its state across docking and floating operations. Clear state when the tool view is closed We're now preserving the tool view state across floating and docking operations. However, we're also preserving that state if the user explicitly closes the tool view, which isn't appropriate. When the user closes the tool view, we should reset the state. The unload event can tell us whether the tool view is being unloaded because of an explicit close operation. In ToolView.tsx , change the handleUnload() function to: const handleUnload = useCallback<toolview.ToolViewUnloadListener>( (isClosing) => { if (isClosing) { toolViewApi.volatileStore.clear(); } else { toolViewApi.volatileStore.set('currentRecordIndex', currentRecordIndex); } }, [toolViewApi, currentRecordIndex] ); Now, if the tool view is being closed, we'll discard our state. Otherwise, we'll persist it. Reload the i2 Notebook web client to test the changes we've made. Closing the tool view will reset the record index. Replace the built-in Record Inspector with our tool view We now have a functional tool view that allows users to view some of the details of a record. We can even use it to replace the web client's built-in Record Inspector! Removing the Record Inspector is easy. Edit public/entrypoint.js to insert the following command-removal code just before the call to initializationComplete() : api.commands.removeCommand(api.commands.systemCommands.toggleRecordInspector); Change the tool view toggle command name to \"Record inspector plug-in\", and add a keyboardHelp section so that the tool can be opened using a keyboard shortcut: const toggle = api.commands.createToolViewToggleCommand( { id: '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000003', name: 'Record inspector plug-in', icon: { type: 'inlineSvg', svg: '<svg viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><circle cx=\"8\" cy=\"8\" r=\"4\" /></svg>', }, keyboardHelp: { category: 'discover', label: 'Toggle record inspector plug-in', keys: ['shift+r'], }, }, toolView ); Reload the i2 Notebook web client, and you should see that: The built-in \"Record Inspector\" tool has been removed. The keyboard help dialog (displayed by pressing \"h\") lists the keyboard shortcut Shift+R for our tool view. Using the keyboard shortcut shift+r also toggles our tool view. Deploy the plug-in Before we can deploy our React plug-in to a real server, we need to make a production build. Run the following command from the plugin-react directory: npm run build This creates a production build of the plug-in inside build . For the actual deployment, we need to add the built plug-in to the server configuration, and then redeploy the server. Note: If you follow this procedure in a deployment that provides high availability, you must complete each step on every Liberty server in your environment before you move to the next step. On the server that hosts the i2 Analyze deployment, find the toolkit/configuration directory, and then navigate to the fragments/opal-services directory that it contains. If the opal-services directory does not already contain a plugins subdirectory, create one. Copy the build directory so that it becomes a subdirectory of plugins , and rename it as you like. For example, plugins/plugin-react . Run the following toolkit commands to update the deployed i2 Analyze server: setup -t stopLiberty setup -t deployLiberty setup -t startLiberty Stop the development proxy, and use the browser to navigate to your real server address. You'll find that your plug-in was successfully deployed. Next steps In this tutorial, we've: Created a command to show a record's position on a map, and added that command to the application ribbon and the chart pop-up menu Created a tool view to display record data, and replaced the built-in Record Inspector with this new tool view Considered data access, formatting, and globalization Deployed our plug-in on the i2 Analyze server This is just a flavor of what you can do with the @i2analyze/notebook-sdk package. To understand more about the capabilities of the i2 Notebook Web API, see the rest of the SDK documentation."

    "title": "Creating a Vue plug-in",
    "keywords": "Creating a Vue plug-in This is a long tutorial that will take a couple of hours to work through. It's designed to function more like a complete hands-on workshop than a simple 'Hello World' example, and takes you from nothing to creating a working (but simplified) replacement for the Record Inspector, using Vue. The tutorial covers the following concepts: Configuring Vue correctly Starting a plug-in project Running the i2 Notebook plug-in development proxy Creating and surfacing commands in the application ribbon and the pop-up menu Subscribing to change and selection events, and using them to control the state of commands Creating a tool view Accessing chart data Accessing user data, such as theme choice and locale Formatting, localization, and right-to-left language support Common mistakes when writing plug-ins, with solutions for fixing them And it does so as you build the example through these stages: Create the simplest possible plug-in, without a custom user interface. We'll get it working in a development environment, and then add a ribbon command that accesses chart data and sends some of it to an external website for viewing. Create a custom tool view, and learn about configuring Vue paths and working with a Content Security Policy. Do some basic styling and theming. Access property data, learn about the facilities that the API provides to assist with consistent formatting, and display images and links to 360 views. (Briefly) cover issues with right-to-left and bidirectional text. Add record-navigation support to the tool view, and learn about restrictions on when you can access i2 Notebook data and best practices for working within those constraints. Learn about persisting tool view state, so that the user interface doesn't reset itself when being docked or floated. Remove the built-in Record Inspector and replace it with our own. Deploy our completed plug-in onto an i2 Analyze server. You can find a full version of the source code for this tutorial in the samples/vue-plugin folder. Prerequisites This tutorial requires a running instance of i2 Analyze on which you have permission to use the i2 Notebook web client. To follow the tutorial, you must install at least version 12 of Node.js on your development machine. For downloads and more information about Node.js, visit the project website at https://nodejs.org . The tutorial also requires you to create GUIDs for a number of its elements. The project files use some sample fixed GUIDs ( 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001 , 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002 , and so on), but you should always create real GUIDs for real projects. Note: A suitable GUID generator is available online at https://www.guidgenerator.com . Create a basic UI-free plug-in A basic i2 Notebook plug-in has the same requirements as a more complex one: in the plug-in directory, you must create the manifest and the entry point that enable the i2 Notebook web client to load and integrate your plug-in. The first part of this tutorial covers those requirements, and also explains how to set up both your development environment and a local Node.js server. Create an empty Vue TypeScript application. For example: npm create vite@latest plugin-vue -- --template vue-ts Note: The Vite build tool comprises a development server and a build command for creating and testing modern web applications. For more information, see https://vitejs.dev . You don't have to use TypeScript to develop a plug-in for i2 Notebook, but the extra type information makes lots of things more robust, and so we do use it in this tutorial. Change directory to the new plug-in and install the dependencies. For example: cd plugin-vue And then: npm install It will likely take several minutes to configure and install the dependencies. Add the i2 Notebook SDK package: npm install @i2analyze/notebook-sdk The package contains a type library that enables inline assistance in your IDE. Now you're in position to write the plug-in itself, starting with the manifest. Using an IDE such as VSCode, create a file named plugin.json in public , with the following contents: { \"$schema\": \"https://i2group.github.io/notebook-sdk/schemas/plugin-manifest.json\" } The schema enforces the structure and content of the file. For more information, see the plug-in manifest documentation. Continue to populate the manifest with values for \"name\" , \"pluginId\" , and \"pluginVersion\" ; and set \"entryPointUrl\" to \"./entrypoint.js\" . For example: \"name\": \"My i2 Notebook plug-in\", \"pluginId\": \"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001\", \"pluginVersion\": \"1.0.0\", \"entryPointUrl\": \"./entrypoint.js\" Next, we can create the entry point. Add a file named entrypoint.js to the public directory, and populate it: // @ts-check /* global notebook */ /// <reference types=\"@i2analyze/notebook-sdk\" /> async function main() { const api = await notebook.getEntryPointApi('00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001', '1.1'); api.logger.info('plug-in running'); api.initializationComplete(); } void main(); Through this code, the plug-in retrieves the version of the entry point API that it wants to use, and uses it to declare that it has finished initializing. The GUID here must match the one in the plug-in manifest. If you enter the code by hand, you'll see how the type library provides auto-completion as you go. Back on the command line, start the Vue project in development mode: npm run dev Make a note of the connection address. For example, http://localhost:5173 . We'll need that to connect to, and reference, our plug-in. Navigate to the project in a web browser. You should see a Vue demonstration page. Confirm that plugin.json and entrypoint.js are served correctly from their respective paths (for example, http://localhost:5173/plugin.json and http://localhost:5173/entrypoint.js ). Test the plug-in in the i2 Notebook web client While we're developing and testing a plug-in, we won't deploy the plug-in directly to the i2 Analyze server. Instead, we'll use the i2 Notebook SDK plug-in development proxy to add our plug-in to an existing i2 Analyze deployment without needing to modify it. Anywhere on your workstation, create and populate a file named devproxy.json : { \"$schema\": \"https://i2group.github.io/notebook-sdk/schemas/devproxy.json\" } This forms the basis of the configuration file for the development proxy. Add a value for \"server\" that is the URL of an existing i2 Analyze deployment. For example, \"http://localhost:9082/opal/\" . Add a value for \"port\" to specify the port that the development proxy should listen on. For example, 4000 . Add a value for \"plugins\" that contains the root URL of your plug-in. For example, [\"http://localhost:5173/\"] for the server that we configured above. On the command line, navigate to the folder that contains the configuration file, and start the i2 Notebook plug-in development proxy (no installation is required): npx @i2analyze/notebook-sdk-plugin-proxy --config devproxy.json Open the proxy URL in a browser (for example, http://localhost:4000/opal/ ), log in to the i2 Notebook web client, and open a new chart. Open the browser's developer console and check for our plug-in's message being logged: If you see this message, then the plug-in is working correctly. Add a ribbon command to the plug-in So far, you have a plug-in that's being loaded into the i2 Notebook web client - but it doesn't do anything. Next, we'll make the plug-in add a command that opens geospatial locations in Google Maps to the application ribbon. In entrypoint.js , just before the call to initializationComplete() , create a command: const viewOnMap = api.commands.createCommand({ id: '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002', name: 'View on map', icon: { type: 'inlineSvg', svg: '<svg viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><rect width=\"8\" height=\"8\" x=\"4\" y=\"4\"/></svg>', }, type: 'records', onExecute(payload) {}, }); Straight afterward, surface the command on the ribbon's Home tab, just after the Information Store group: api.commands.applicationRibbon.homeTab .after(api.commands.applicationRibbon.homeTab.systemGroups.searchInfoStore) .surfaceCommands(viewOnMap); Reload the i2 Notebook web client, and check that the action is visible in the application ribbon. Clicking the button won't do anything yet because we haven't implemented onExecute() , so let's do that now. Create this helper function at the top level of the entrypoint.js file: /** * @param {import(\"@i2analyze/notebook-sdk\").data.IReadOnlyCollection<import(\"@i2analyze/notebook-sdk\").records.IChartRecord>} records */ function findGeospatialValue(records) { for (const record of records) { for (const propertyType of record.itemType.propertyTypes) { if (propertyType.logicalType === 'geospatial') { const property = record.getProperty(propertyType); if (property !== undefined && !record.isValueUnfetched(property)) { return /** @type {import(\"@i2analyze/notebook-sdk\").data.IGeoPoint} */ (property); } } } } return undefined; } This function performs a simple scan of the records it receives, looking for a non-empty geospatial property that it returns if it finds one. Note: The /** @type {import...} */ and /** @param {import...} */ code helps the JavaScript type system to understand what we're working with, which enables auto-completion in the rest of the code. If we used TypeScript to create our entrypoint.js file, we'd use import type statements instead. We can now use the helper function in the implementation of onExecute() that we left empty in the call to CreateCommand() . We'll take the latitude and longitude to a new Google Maps window: onExecute(payload) { const property = findGeospatialValue(payload.records); if (!property) { return; } window.open( `https://www.google.com/maps/@${property.latitude},${property.longitude},18z`, \"_blank\" ); }, Reload the web client again, select an element with a geospatial property, and try the command. Google Maps should open at the relevant location. Make the command sensitive to selection There's a problem with our command: the button is enabled even if the selection doesn't actually contain a geospatial property. That would be misleading for a user, but we can fix it by taking control of the surfacing of the command in the user interface. After the onExecute() parameter to createCommand() , add an onSurface() function definition: onSurface(action, eventApi, signal) { eventApi.addEventListener( \"recordscontextchange\", (context) => { action.setEnabled(!!findGeospatialValue(context.records)); }, { dispatchNow: true, signal } ); }, There are a few things to notice here: i2 Notebook calls our onSurface() function with an action object that represents the user interface control to which the command is bound each time it is surfaced. A single command might be surfaced in several places, and you can use the action object to react differently in each of them. The function also receives an eventApi object through which it can listen to changes in the records to which the action is being applied; and a signal object that indicates when this particular surfacing of the command is being removed. In our implementation, we subscribe to the recordscontextchange event, which tells us when the current records change. When they do change, we set the enabled state of the action to a value based on whether there is a geospatial value in the current records. Event listeners are normally invoked when the event occurs. However, we don't want to wait for a recordscontextchange event before we run our setEnabled() code, so we specify dispatchNow: true to invoke the callback immediately, without waiting for the event. This in turn causes our action to be enabled or disabled correctly, right away. We forward the signal to the event listener so that it unsubscribes automatically from the recordscontextchange event when the action is unsurfaced. Reload the i2 Notebook web client. The button in the application ribbon is now enabled only when a geospatial property exists in the selection. Use the command in more than one place As well as adding it to the ribbon, we can add exactly the same command to the chart pop-up menu with a single line of code. After the existing call to surfaceCommands() , add: api.commands.chartItemPopupMenu.surfaceCommands(viewOnMap); Reload the web client. The same command, with the same enablement rules, is now present in the chart's pop-up menu. Create a tool view The first part of this tutorial didn't use any features from the Vue framework! That changes now, as we use Vue to create a custom user interface for our plug-in. Navigate to the src/components folder inside the project directory, and create a Vue component in a new file named ToolView.vue : <template> <div>tool-view1 works!</div> </template> <script lang=\"ts\"> import { defineComponent } from 'vue'; export default defineComponent({ name: 'ToolView', }); </script> <style scoped></style> In the parent src folder, replace the contents of the generated App.vue file with: <template> <div><ToolView /></div> </template> <script lang=\"ts\"> import { defineComponent } from 'vue'; import ToolView from './components/ToolView.vue'; export default defineComponent({ name: 'App', components: { ToolView, }, }); </script> <style></style> In a web browser, load the root page ( / ) from your Vue development environment ( http://localhost:5173/ ). You should see the message: \"tool-view1 works!\". We'll now turn the Vue component into an i2 Notebook tool view. In public/entrypoint.js , insert a line before the call to initializationComplete() : const toolView = api.createToolView('My tool view', './'); This line declares a tool view by specifying its display name ('My tool view') and its location relative to the entry point , which is ' ./ '. Still in the entry point code, tell i2 Notebook to create a command that opens and closes the tool view: const toggle = api.commands.createToolViewToggleCommand( { id: '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000003', name: 'My tool', icon: { type: 'inlineSvg', svg: '<svg viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><circle cx=\"8\" cy=\"8\" r=\"4\" /></svg>', }, }, toolView ); Finally, surface the command in the application ribbon's Home tab. This code places it after the View on map command that we developed above: api.commands.applicationRibbon.homeTab.after(viewOnMap.id).surfaceCommands(toggle); Reload the i2 Notebook web client, and you'll see the new button in the ribbon. Click it to display the tool view in the user interface; click it a second time to hide it again. However, while the tool view pane is correctly opening and closing, there's a problem: we don't see the contents of our tool view in the pane. There are actually several reasons why the tool view isn't working yet. We'll take them one at a time. To see what's happening, open up the developer tools in your browser, and look at the network diagnostics. When you click to display the tool view, you'll see that requests to load resources are failing due to content security policy restrictions. We'll fix those problems in the next section. Configure Vue to serve content from the correct place New Vue applications are hard-wired to serve their content from the root ( / ) of the server they're running on. i2 Notebook plug-ins, on the other hand, are served from <context root>/plugins/<some directory> on the i2 Analyze server, and our plug-in development proxy is simulating that for us. When you display the Vue tool view, the .html file loads correctly, but the .ts file fails to load because the .html file refers to it relative to the root - for example, /src/main.ts . This would work if the plug-in were served from / , but as it won't be, we need to make Vue generate the path differently. We'll adjust the Vite configuration to serve the content from an explicit, hard-coded path. Find the context path that your Liberty server is using. This is the path part of the server URL in your development proxy configuration file. For example, if your server is http://someserver:1234/contextpath , then it's /contextpath that we need. Pick a short plug-in folder name, such as myplugin . The name needs to be different from every other plug-in in your deployment, but remember that you won't have to use it at deployment time; only during development. The path to your plug-in will be /<contextpath>/plugins/<shortname> . For example, /opal/plugins/myplugin . Modify the path to your plug-in in the development proxy configuration file, adding the plug-in path. For example, replace http://localhost:5173/ with http://localhost:5173/opal/plugins/myplugin . Open the vite.config.ts file in the project root, and add base: '/opal/plugins/myplugin' to the defineConfig object: export default defineConfig({ plugins: [vue()], base: '/opal/plugins/myplugin', }); Stop the development proxy, and then start it again with the same command as before. Reload the i2 Notebook web client and try the tool view again. The 'tool-view1 works!' text should now be displayed in the tool view panel. However, if you're using a dark theme in the application, it might be hard to see the black text on a dark background. We'll fix that by adding some simple theming support, but before we can do so, we must fix another problem. Look in the browser console, and you'll see some warnings about the browser refusing to apply inline styles because of a violation of another content security policy (CSP) directive. We must fix that before we'll be able to apply any styling successfully. Configure the Content Security Policy i2 Notebook runs with a heavily locked-down Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the attack surface. Vue, however, uses features (specifically, inline styling) that require a looser CSP. We can use the plug-in manifest to loosen the CSP for our tool view. Edit the public/plugin.json file and add a \"toolViewCsp\" section: \"toolViewCsp\": { \"style-src\": \"'unsafe-inline'\" } Once again, reload the i2 Notebook web client and display the tool view. The browser console will now be free of styling CSP errors, so we can proceed with some styling. Note: If you open the developer tools at this point and look at the console, you will still see other CSP errors where Vite is trying to connect to ws://... . These violations are due to the Vite application developer environment, and you can safely ignore them. Create a component that provides the tool view API We'll need to access the i2 Notebook tool view API from multiple components in our Vue application. Also, because fetching the API is asynchronous, we'll want to prevent the Vue application from loading until it is ready and available to use. To address both of these requirements, we can make the tool view API available through a Vue component. In the src folder, replace the contents of App.vue with the following: <template> <div v-if=\"toolViewApi\"> <ToolView :toolViewApi=\"toolViewApi\" /> </div> </template> <script lang=\"ts\"> import { getToolViewApi, toolview } from '@i2analyze/notebook-sdk'; import { defineComponent } from 'vue'; import ToolView from './components/ToolView.vue'; export default defineComponent({ name: 'App', components: { ToolView, }, data() { return { toolViewApi: undefined as toolview.IToolViewApi | undefined, }; }, async mounted() { this.toolViewApi = await getToolViewApi(); }, }); </script> <style></style> Let's walk through that code: The App component imports the getToolViewApi() function from the @i2analyze/notebook-sdk package. It calls that function inside a mounted() method, so that getToolViewApi() is called when the App instance is mounted. After getToolViewApi() returns its value asynchronously, that value is put into the toolViewApi data property. Until toolViewApi has a value, App renders nothing. When toolViewApi is available (in practice this will be almost immediately), it renders <ToolView :toolViewApi=\"toolViewApi\" /> , which makes the API value available via a prop in the child component ( ToolView ). Configure the tool view for i2 Notebook web client themes The i2 Notebook web client supports a number of visual themes. If you're using a light theme, the \"tool-view1 works!\" text should have been clear in your tool view. But if you're using a dark theme, the text was probably harder to read. We haven't yet configured the tool view to respect and respond to themes. Note: To change the theme in the i2 Notebook web client, go to the user menu and select Settings to open the Settings dialog. To style our tool view correctly, we need to access the theme information and use it to change the appearance of the text. First, in src/main.ts , remove the import './style.css' . In src/components/ToolView.vue , add the following CSS to the <style> element: .dark-theme { color: white; } .light-theme { color: black; } In other words, we want to set the font color to white in dark themes, and to black in light themes. In the same file, modify the component so that it accepts the toolViewApi property and uses it to set the component styling: <template> <div :class=\"themeClass\">tool-view1 works!</div> </template> <script lang=\"ts\"> import { toolview } from '@i2analyze/notebook-sdk'; import { defineComponent, PropType } from 'vue'; export default defineComponent({ name: 'ToolView', props: { toolViewApi: { type: Object as PropType<toolview.IToolViewApi>, required: true, }, }, computed: { themeClass(): string { return this.toolViewApi.theme.appearance === 'dark' ? 'dark-theme' : 'light-theme'; }, }, }); </script> Now, our tool view will apply the light-theme or dark-theme class based on theme information from the i2 Notebook web client. Reload the i2 Notebook web client and display the tool view again. Change the theme by swapping between light and dark, and notice how the tool view automatically adjusts its text coloring to match. Access record data We've done a lot of work to make our tool view integrate nicely with the i2 Notebook web client. Now it needs to do something useful. Let's enable it to access the data in selected records, which starts by working out what the current selection is : In src/components/ToolView.vue , add the mounted() method to the ToolView component, and subscribe to the chartselectionchange event. Also add the unmounted() method to clean up the subscription when the ToolView component is unmounted: mounted() { this.toolViewApi.addEventListener( \"chartselectionchange\", this.handleChartSelectionChange ); }, unmounted() { this.toolViewApi.removeEventListener( \"chartselectionchange\", this.handleChartSelectionChange ); } And then add the selection change handler to the methods object: methods: { handleChartSelectionChange() { this.toolViewApi.logger.info(\"Chart selection has changed\"); } } Reload the i2 Notebook web client and open the browser console. As you change the selection on the chart, you should see messages from your tool view: \" My i2 Notebook plug-in Chart selection has changed\". The chartselectionchange event provides the current selection in its payload. Change the implementation of handleChartSelectionChange() to take the label from the first record in the selection and display it in the tool view: Still in ToolView.vue , add the chart and records namespaces from the @i2analyze/notebook-sdk package to the existing import statement: import { toolview, chart, records } from '@i2analyze/notebook-sdk'; In the ToolView component, add a data() function with a recordLabel property: data() { return { recordLabel: \"\" } } Change handleChartSelectionChange() as follows, and add setValuesForRecord() to the methods object: methods: { handleChartSelectionChange(selection: chart.ISelection) { const record = selection.records.firstOrDefault(undefined); this.setValuesForRecord(record); }, setValuesForRecord(record: records.IChartRecord | undefined) { if (record) { this.recordLabel = record.labelOrFallback; } else { this.recordLabel = \"No records selected.\"; } } } The firstOrDefault function returns the first record from the selection, falling back to the specified undefined if there isn't a first record. The labelOrFallback property reads the label of the record, falling back to a standard string if empty. Now we'll display the extracted record label. Replace the existing <template> element with: <template> <div :class=\"themeClass\"> <h1 class=\"record-header\">{{ recordLabel }}</h1> </div> </template> Note: This and later HTML code uses CSS classes to apply styling to the tool view. To add the classes to your project, replace the <style> element in this file with its equivalent from the ToolView.vue file on Github . Try the tool view again. Click around on the chart, selecting different items. It does now display the label of the first record in the chart selection, but there's still a problem. Close the tool view, select an item on the chart, and then open the tool view again. Notice that when the tool view opens , it's not displaying the record label. After you change the selection, the tool view does display the label correctly, but it's not displaying correctly at startup. The problem is that we're only setting the recordLabel field after a chartselectionchange event is received. Adding the dispatchNow option to the addEventListener subscription arranges for the chartselectionchange handler to be called immediately. In ToolView.vue , inside the mounted() method addEventListener call, add a dispatchNow: true option: mounted() { this.toolViewApi.addEventListener( \"chartselectionchange\", this.handleChartSelectionChange, { dispatchNow: true } ); } Reload the web client again, select an item, and open the tool view. This time, it immediately displays the label of the first selected record (or our \"No records selected.\" message) without waiting for a selection change. Display property data We have the record label, but we can build up our tool view to display data from more record properties. In ToolView.vue , modify the existing import to add the schema namespace: import { chart, records, schema, toolview } from '@i2analyze/notebook-sdk'; Declare an interface that represents how we'll display the properties that we're going to retrieve: interface IProperty { id: schema.ChartPropertyTypeId; label: string; value: string; } Next, after the recordLabel , add a property to the data() function that will store the record property information: data() { return { recordLabel: \"\", properties: [] as IProperty[] }; } And edit setValuesForRecord() to extract property as well as label information from the record: setValuesForRecord(record: records.IChartRecord | undefined) { const formatter = this.toolViewApi.formatter; if (record) { this.recordLabel = record.labelOrFallback; const properties: IProperty[] = []; for (const propertyType of record.itemType.propertyTypes) { const label = propertyType.displayName; const value = record.getProperty(propertyType); if (value !== undefined && !record.isValueUnfetched(value)) { const formattedValue = formatter.formatValue(value); properties.push({ id: propertyType.id, label, value: formattedValue, }); } } this.properties = properties; } else { this.recordLabel = \"No records selected.\"; this.properties = []; } } The record.getProperty() method can return values of type undefined , data.IValueNotFetched , or data.PropertyValue : An undefined value indicates that the record has no value for the specified property type. A not-fetched property value ( data.IValueNotFetched ) indicates that the record does have a value for the property, but we don't have that value in the client at the moment. Note: You can ensure the property is fetched by using the chart.ensurePropertiesFetched() method. A property value ( data.PropertyValue ) can be an object representing any of the legal data types in the schema. It might be a string, or a number, or a more complicated object such as a date, time, date-time, decimal, or geospatial structure. Vue cannot directly render any of these structures, so we use the formatter.formatValue() method to produce standard i2 Notebook string representations of them. When we have a record, we filter out the undefined and not-fetched properties before displaying the remainder in our tool view. When we have no record at all, we set the properties to be an empty array. In ToolView.vue , add some elements to the <template> to display the property data after the record label: <template> <div :class=\"themeClass\"> <h1 class=\"record-header\">{{ recordLabel }}</h1> <div class=\"record-properties\"> <div class=\"property\" v-for=\"property in properties\" :key=\"property.id\"> <div class=\"property-label\">{{ property.label }}</div> <div class=\"property-value\">{{ property.value }}</div> </div> </div> </div> </template> Reload the i2 Notebook web client and try out the tool view. Property values are now displayed, and numbers, dates, and times are formatted the same as in the rest of the application. Display an image and a link to more information So far, our tool view displays the label of a selected record and its property values. In this section, we'll go further by displaying an image to represent the record, and by linking to its 360 view (if it has one). First, add data to the existing import from @i2analyze/notebook-sdk : import { chart, data, records, schema, toolview } from '@i2analyze/notebook-sdk'; Add properties in the data() function inside the ToolView component to store the image and the URL: data() { ..., threeSixtyUrl: undefined as string | undefined, image: undefined as data.IImage | undefined } In the setValuesForRecord() method, set these properties if we have a record, and clear them if we don't: if (record) { this.recordLabel = record.labelOrFallback; this.threeSixtyUrl = record.get360ViewUrl(); this.image = record.image || (record.isEntity() ? record.itemType.image : undefined); ... } else { this.recordLabel = 'No records selected.'; this.threeSixtyUrl = undefined; this.image = undefined; ... } This code uses the record image if one exists, and falls back to the image associated with the record's item type if it does not. In ToolView.vue 's <template> element, edit the heading to display the image and the link (if it exists): <h1 class=\"record-header\"> <img v-if=\"image\" :src=\"image.href\" :alt=\"image.description\" class=\"record-image\" /> <a v-if=\"threeSixtyUrl\" :href=\"threeSixtyUrl\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"record-label\"> {{ recordLabel }} </a> <span v-else class=\"record-label\">{{ recordLabel }}</span> </h1> The target=\"_blank\" attribute on the <a> element is so that the view opens in a new browser tab or window, rather than in the tool view! Reload the i2 Notebook web client once again, and watch the behavior of the tool view: For entity records that came from the Information Store, the label is now also a hyperlink. For all records that have images, the tool view displays that image. Support globalization Not all users speak English, and not all languages are read from left to right. If your tool view is aimed internationally, it should flow and display its contents correctly in all locales. The i2 Notebook Web API includes support for dealing with localization. First, let's demonstrate one of the problems by simulating an Arabic locale. In your browser address bar, after the contextpath part of the address, add the query parameter ?translationLocale=ar-sa and reload the page. (For example, http://localhost:4000/opal/?translationLocale=ar-sa#charts ) The i2 Notebook web client responds by simulating the locale of Arabic (Saudi Arabia). Note: The web client actually provides two locales: the translationLocale , which is used for the translation of the text; and the formattingLocale , which is used for formatting data for display. The ?translationLocale query parameter simulates both the translation and the formatting locale. If you display the built-in Record Inspector tool (using the R keyboard shortcut), you'll see how its user interface now flows from right to left. When you open your tool view, however, it still flows from left to right. The API can provide the information that we need. We just have to use it in the right place! In the <template> element inside ToolView.vue , add a dir attribute to the top-level <div> element: <div :dir=\"toolViewApi.locale.flowDirection\" :class=\"themeClass\"></div> The flowDirection property has either the value ltr or rtl , which is perfect for use with the dir HTML attribute. Reload the i2 Notebook web client and display the tool view again. It's laid out correctly according to the locale. When you add and remove the ?translationLocale=ar-sa query parameter, the flow alternates between left-to-right and right-to-left behavior. Note: By using the built-in formatter for property values, we get date, time, and numeric formatting for the Arabic (Saudi Arabia) locale automatically. Select items on your chart that have date, time, or numeric properties to see this in action. Another globalization issue is the text in the tool view. When simulating the Arabic (Saudi Arabia) locale, the \"No records selected.\" text doesn't display correctly - it actually displays as \".No records selected\". This problem occurs because the browser is trying to lay out the text from right to left, but it doesn't realize that the \".\" is meant to flow with the text, and shouldn't be considered by itself. (This issue affects most punctuation characters and numbers that aren't considered to be \"left-to-right\" or \"right-to-left\", but instead take their directionality from the context around them.) To get the text to behave correctly, we need to mark it up with bidirectional characters. Once again, we can use the formatter from the tool view API. Inside ToolView.vue , find the implementation of setValuesForRecord() . When we set the record label, we'll use the formatter to wrap it with bidirectional characters: ... this.recordLabel = formatter.wrapForBidi(record.labelOrFallback, 'raw'); ... this.recordLabel = formatter.wrapForBidi('No records selected.', 'raw'); Reload the i2 Notebook web client, and continue to simulate the Arabic (Saudi Arabia) locale. The text is now wrapped correctly, and displays with the period at the end of the text as \"No records selected.\" In general, you should use wrapForBidi() for all read-only text that you display to the user. It's particularly important for text whose contents you don't know in advance because it comes from record data. Update the plug-in code to use wrapForBidi() throughout ToolView.vue . In methods , the setValuesForRecord() function becomes: setValuesForRecord(record: records.IChartRecord | undefined) { const formatter = this.toolViewApi.formatter; if (record) { this.recordLabel = formatter.wrapForBidi(record.labelOrFallback, \"raw\"); this.threeSixtyUrl = record.get360ViewUrl(); this.image = record.image || (record.isEntity() ? record.itemType.image : undefined); const properties: IProperty[] = []; for (const propertyType of record.itemType.propertyTypes) { const label = formatter.wrapForBidi(propertyType.displayName, 'raw'); const value = record.getProperty(propertyType); if (value !== undefined && !record.isValueUnfetched(value)) { const formattedValue = formatter.formatValue(value); properties.push({ id: propertyType.id, label, value: formatter.wrapForBidi(formattedValue, 'raw'), }); } } this.properties = properties; } else { this.recordLabel = formatter.wrapForBidi(\"No records selected.\", \"raw\"); this.threeSixtyUrl = undefined; this.image = undefined; this.properties = []; } } A further consideration for good globalization is that some images and icons should be reversed in right-to-left locales, while others should not. For example, back and forward navigation buttons should always be mirrored. For more information on this and other topics, consult a resource such as https://material.io/design/usability/bidirectionality.html#mirroring-elements . Before you continue with this tutorial, remove the ?translationLocale=ar-sa query parameter to stop simulating the Arabic (Saudi Arabia) locale. Add record navigation to the tool view So far, we have looked only at the first record in the selection, which is useful in an example but not realistic. Now let's look at all the records in the selection, and provide the user with a pair of buttons to page through those records and inspect their properties. As part of this work, we'll demonstrate what errors can occur if you access the data incorrectly, and then show you how to access the data correctly. In the ToolView component, add properties for the index of the current record, the total number of records, and the current selection to the data() function: data() { ..., currentRecordIndex: 0, totalRecords: 0, selection: undefined as chart.ISelection | undefined } We'll store the selection and choose a record based on currentRecordIndex . Replace the implementation of handleChartSelectionChange() with the following code: methods: { handleChartSelectionChange(selection: chart.ISelection) { this.selection = selection; this.currentRecordIndex = 0; this.totalRecords = selection.records.size; this.readDataForCurrentRecord(); }, readDataForCurrentRecord() { const record = this.totalRecords && this.selection ? Array.from(this.selection.records)[this.currentRecordIndex] : undefined; this.setValuesForRecord(record); } } Note: This code isn't quite right, but we'll explain why (and come back and fix it) shortly. Here, we've extracted the code that reads the record data and saves it in our component to a separate method named readDataForCurrentRecord() . We are now saving the selection and resetting the currentRecordIndex on every chart selection change. Next, we're going to move the responsibility for reporting a lack of records from the record display to a title area. In the setValuesForRecord() method, replace this code: this.recordLabel = formatter.wrapForBidi('No records selected.', 'raw'); with: this.recordLabel = ''; Add handler methods to update the currentRecordIndex and set the new record data; properties to indicate when the \"previous\" and \"next\" buttons are disabled; and a property named currentRecord that formats the current record index for display. Still in the ToolView component, add: computed: { ..., disablePreviousButton(): boolean { return this.currentRecordIndex === 0; }, disableNextButton(): boolean { return this.currentRecordIndex === this.totalRecords - 1; }, currentRecord(): number { return this.currentRecordIndex + 1; } }, methods: { ..., onPreviousButtonClick() { this.currentRecordIndex--; this.readDataForCurrentRecord(); }, onNextButtonClick() { this.currentRecordIndex++; this.readDataForCurrentRecord(); } } In the same component, add a computed navigationTitle property: computed: { ..., navigationTitle(): string { const formatter = this.toolViewApi.formatter; if (this.totalRecords === 0) { return formatter.wrapForBidi(\"No records selected.\", \"raw\"); } const currentRecord = formatter.formatValue(this.currentRecord); const totalRecords = formatter.formatValue(this.totalRecords); return formatter.wrapForBidi( `Record ${currentRecord} of ${totalRecords}`, \"raw\" ); } } This code creates a title with formatted numbers for the selected record and the total record count. In <template> , above the <h1> element, add the title and our navigation buttons: <div class=\"record-navigation\"> <div>{{ navigationTitle }}</div> <div class=\"navigation-buttons\" v-if=\"totalRecords\"> <button class=\"navigation-button\" @click=\"onPreviousButtonClick\" title=\"Previous record\" :disabled=\"disablePreviousButton\" > &lt; </button> <button class=\"navigation-button\" @click=\"onNextButtonClick\" title=\"Next record\" :disabled=\"disableNextButton\" > &gt; </button> </div> </div> This gives users a pair of buttons for changing the current record, and a title displaying which record they're viewing out of the total. It hides the buttons if there are no records selected. Reload the i2 Notebook web client and open the plug-in. It doesn't work. If you look in the console, you'll see two types of error message. Here's the first: TypeError: 'get' on proxy: property '_properties' is a read-only and non-configurable data property on the proxy target but the proxy did not return its actual value. Vue reports an error here because of the way we're storing the selection inside data() . However, it's safe to ignore it for now, because of what we're going to do next. The more serious problem arises when you try to change the current record in the tool view by selecting multiple items on the chart and clicking the Next button. You'll see this: Application and chart data MUST only be accessed during event listener or transaction listener callbacks. It is not safe to access data at any other time. We are trying to access data outside an event or transaction listener. We store the selection data in our component, and attempt to read it when the user clicks Next . It doesn't matter if you're storing the selection or the records. You cannot access i2 Notebook chart data outside an event, mutation, or transaction listener. This rule ensures that API consumers always see a consistent view of the application data. Whenever you want to read data outside an event handler, you must request access to it from the application through a transaction or a mutation. Remove the selection property from the data() function. Instead of storing the records, we'll use the current record index to request the record that we want from the application. Change the handleChartSelectionChange() implementation to: handleChartSelectionChange() { this.currentRecordIndex = 0; this.readDataForCurrentRecord(); }, Change the readDataForCurrentRecord() method so that it requests the record data from the tool view API in a transaction handler: readDataForCurrentRecord() { this.toolViewApi.runTransaction((application) => { const records = application.chart.selection.records; const recordIds = Array.from(records.map((r) => r.id)); this.totalRecords = records.size; const currentRecordId = recordIds[this.currentRecordIndex]; const record = records.get(currentRecordId); this.setValuesForRecord(record); }); } It's safe to access chart data during the callback, and we take advantage by populating the component fields with data from the current record. Reload the i2 Notebook web client, select multiple items on the chart, and try using the buttons in our tool view to navigate among their records. Now, it works! Extension: Ensure fetched properties While viewing record properties, eventually a property will be shown as Exists but not fetched . You can ensure that the property is fetched. Change the readDataForCurrentRecord() method so that it ensures all properties are fetched before setting the values for records: readDataForCurrentRecord() { this.toolViewApi.runTransaction((application) => { const records = application.chart.selection.records; const recordIds = Array.from(records.map((r) => r.id)); this.totalRecords = records.size; const currentRecordId = recordIds[this.currentRecordIndex]; const record = records.get(currentRecordId); if (record) { const propertyTypes = record.itemType.propertyTypes; application.chart.ensurePropertiesFetched(record, propertyTypes); } this.setValuesForRecord(record); }); }, Store and restore state when the tool view is floated and docked Our tool view is almost complete, but for now there are still problems to solve. For example, you can select multiple items on the chart surface, and navigate to the second record in the selection by clicking Next . But if you then float the tool view, it returns to showing the first record again. When a tool view is docked or floated, its user interface is completely recreated in a different browser window, causing all of its temporary state to be lost. To address this, we can make use of the volatile store that's available from the tool view API. This store allows us to store state so that it survives tool view re-creation. (It's called the \"volatile\" store because its state does not persist across application reloads.) In ToolView.vue , at the end of the mounted() method, just after we subscribe to the chartselectionchange event, add some state persistence logic: mounted() { ... this.toolViewApi.addEventListener(\"unload\", () => { this.toolViewApi.volatileStore.set( \"currentRecordIndex\", this.currentRecordIndex ); }); this.currentRecordIndex = this.toolViewApi.volatileStore.get(\"currentRecordIndex\") || 0; this.readDataForCurrentRecord(); } This code means that we store currentRecordIndex when the tool view is unloaded, and retrieve it from the volatile store when the tool view is mounted. Because we're now fetching data immediately when the tool view starts up, we no longer need to use the dispatchNow option for the chartselectionchange event handler in mounted() . Remove it, leaving the event subscription as follows: this.toolViewApi.addEventListener('chartselectionchange', this.handleChartSelectionChange); The tool view now correctly maintains its state across docking and floating operations. Clear state when the tool view is closed We're now preserving the tool view state across floating and docking operations. However, we're also preserving that state if the user explicitly closes the tool view, which isn't appropriate. When the user closes the tool view, we should reset the state. The unload event can tell us whether the tool view is being unloaded because of an explicit close operation. In the ToolView component, inside mounted() , change the unload event handler to: this.toolViewApi.addEventListener('unload', (isClosing) => { if (isClosing) { this.toolViewApi.volatileStore.clear(); } else { this.toolViewApi.volatileStore.set('currentRecordIndex', this.currentRecordIndex); } }); Now, if the tool view is being closed, we'll discard our state. Otherwise, we'll persist it. Reload the i2 Notebook web client to test the changes we've made. Closing the tool view will reset the record index. Replace the built-in Record Inspector with our tool view We now have a functional tool view that allows users to view some of the details of a record. We can even use it to replace the web client's built-in Record Inspector! Removing the Record Inspector is easy. Edit public/entrypoint.js to insert the following command-removal code just before the call to initializationComplete() : api.commands.removeCommand(api.commands.systemCommands.toggleRecordInspector); Change the tool view toggle command name to \"Record inspector plug-in\", and add a keyboardHelp section so that the tool can be opened using a keyboard shortcut: const toggle = api.commands.createToolViewToggleCommand( { id: '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000003', name: 'Record inspector plug-in', icon: { type: 'inlineSvg', svg: '<svg viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\"><circle cx=\"8\" cy=\"8\" r=\"4\" /></svg>', }, keyboardHelp: { category: 'discover', label: 'Toggle record inspector plug-in', keys: ['shift+r'], }, }, toolView ); Reload the i2 Notebook web client, and you should see that: The built-in \"Record Inspector\" tool has been removed. The keyboard help dialog (displayed by pressing \"h\") lists the keyboard shortcut Shift+R for our tool view. Using the keyboard shortcut shift+r also toggles our tool view. Deploy the plug-in To deploy our plug-in on the server, we need to build it by running: npm run build from the plugin-vue directory. This creates a production build of our tutorial plug-in inside dist . For the actual deployment, we need to add the built plug-in to the server configuration, and then redeploy the server. Note: If you follow this procedure in a deployment that provides high availability, you must complete each step on every Liberty server in your environment before you move to the next step. On the server that hosts the i2 Analyze deployment, find the toolkit/configuration directory, and then navigate to the fragments/opal-services directory that it contains. If the opal-services directory does not already contain a plugins subdirectory, create one. Copy the dist directory so that it becomes a subdirectory of plugins , and rename it as you like. For example, plugins/plugin-vue . Run the following toolkit commands to update the deployed i2 Analyze server: setup -t stopLiberty setup -t deployLiberty setup -t startLiberty Stop the development proxy, and use the browser to navigate to your real server address. You'll find that your plug-in was successfully deployed. Next steps In this tutorial, we've: Created a command to show a record's position on a map, and added that command to the application ribbon and the chart pop-up menu Created a tool view to display record data, and replaced the built-in Record Inspector with this new tool view Considered data access, formatting, and globalization Deployed our plug-in on the i2 Analyze server This is just a flavor of what you can do with the @i2analyze/notebook-sdk package. To understand more about the capabilities of the i2 Notebook Web API, see the rest of the SDK documentation."

    "title": "Unfetched property values",
    "keywords": "Unfetched property values The values of properties with logical types such as multipleLineString can be large. To reduce memory and bandwidth consumption, the i2 Notebook web client does not always fetch these values when it fetches records that contain them from the server. In code that manipulates property values, you must take the possibility of unfetched values into account. With a record in hand, you can distinguish between a property that actually has no value, and a property whose value has not yet been fetched, in two different ways: Call the isValueUnfetched() method on the value of an individual property. Test hasUnfetchedProperties on the record, and then call getUnfetchedPropertyTypes() . Requesting unfetched property values You can request unfetched property values from within a transaction or a mutation by calling IChart.ensurePropertiesFetched() . This asynchronous method fetches values from the server for the specified properties of the specified records. For example: getToolViewApi().runTransaction(async (application) => { const record = application.chart.records.get(myRecordId); const propertyType = record.itemType.propertyTypes.get(myPropertyTypeId); // Check if the value of the property with type 'propertyType' has been // fetched for 'record'. If not, request the value from the server. await application.chart.ensurePropertiesFetched([record], propertyType); }); For performance reasons, ensurePropertiesFetched() actually takes an array of records. It can fetch properties for many records efficiently in a small number of server round-trips. Calling it repeatedly for one record at a time results in much poorer performance and increased network use. Fetching property values is not itself a mutation operation, and does not form part of the undo action that a tracked mutation constructs. Note: The i2 Notebook web client is at liberty to dispose of property values that you fetch through ensurePropertiesFetched() . Do not rely on fetched values remaining fetched for all time."

    "keywords": "SDK and API versioning The i2 Notebook SDK and the i2 Notebook API have separate but related version numbers: i2 Notebook SDK The SDK version number is the version of the SDK package that you install when you start to create i2 Notebook plug-ins . You can find out the SDK version number from the installed package.json file: \"@i2analyze/notebook-sdk\": \"Major.Minor.Patch\" The following table shows the relationship between a version of the SDK and the first version of i2 Analyze in which its new features are available: i2 Notebook SDK version i2 Analyze version 1.8.* 4.4.6.0 1.7.* 4.4.5.0 1.6.* 4.4.4.5 1.5.* 4.4.4.0 1.4.* 4.4.3.0 1.3.* 4.4.2.0 1.2.* 4.4.1.0 1.1.* 4.4.0.0 1.0.* 4.3.4.0 i2 Notebook API The API version number is the version of the types contained in the SDK package, in the format \"Major.Minor\" . The API version number is based on the SDK version number, but does not include a Patch component. In general, version M . N of the Notebook SDK package contains the types for version M . N of the API. For example, Notebook SDK package v1.4. x contains the types for v1.4 of the API. An increment to the major version number of the SDK (or the API) indicates that the new version is not backward-compatible with older versions. In other words, this is a breaking change, and you will need to update your plug-in code to use it with new versions of the i2 Notebook web client. A increment to the minor or patch version number of the SDK (or the API) indicates a non-breaking change that introduces new functionality or provides non-critical bug fixes and improvements. Any plug-in code that you wrote for an earlier minor version is unaffected by non-breaking changes. To learn more about standard versioning principles, see the documentation at semver.org ."

For example, you might use a plug-in to add a new command to the application ribbon, or to provide a new tool for analyzing or displaying data in a way that's integrated with the rest of the i2 Notebook user interface. The i2 Notebook web client exposes a JavaScript API that i2 Notebook plug-ins can target with JavaScript or TypeScript code. For a plug-in that has a visual representation, you can write user interface code in HTML/CSS, or by using a framework such as Angular, React, or Vue. Note: During development, if you want to use a third-party framework or our plug-in proxy, Node.js is required. When development is complete, plug-ins do not require Node.js in order to run. The table of contents on the left includes conceptual and tutorial documentation for the i2 Notebook SDK: The topics that follow this introduction describe the structure of plug-ins for the i2 Notebook web client, and introduce some features of the SDK. The Tutorials section contains worked examples of using the SDK to create i2 Notebook plug-ins. You don't need to read the conceptual documentation before you follow the tutorials. The conceptual documentation provides more information about subjects that the tutorials mention in passing. You can return to those topics when you create plug-ins of your own.
